<p>Article 5 The calculation of VAT exemption, offset and refund and VAT exemption and refund.</p>
<ol>
<li>VAT exemption, offset and refund of exported goods and services of the manufacturing enterprises shall be calculated according to the following formula,</li>
</ol>
<p>(1) Calculation of the taxable amount for the current period</p>
<p>Tax payable for the current period = Output tax payable for the current period – Tax which may not be exempted or offset for the current period </p>
<p>Tax which may not be exempted or offset for the current period = FOB Price of exported goods for the current period × RMB conversion rate × (Applicable tax rate of exported goods – Tax refund rate of exported goods) - Deductible amount for the tax which may not be exempted or offset for the current period</p>
<p>Deductible amount for the tax which may not be exempted or offset for the current period = Price of tax-free purchased raw materials for the current period × (applicable tax rate of exported goods – tax refund rate of exported goods)</p>
<p>(2) Calculation of the tax exempted, offset and refunded for the current period</p>
<p>Tax exempted, offset and refunded for the current period =FOB Price of exported goods for the current period × RMB conversion rate × Tax refund rate of exported goods - Deductible amount for the tax exempted, offset and refunded for the current period</p>
<p>Deductible amount for the tax exempted, offset and refunded for the current period = Price of tax-free purchased raw materials for the current period ×Tax refund rate of exported goods</p>
<p>(3) Calculation of the tax amount to be refunded and the tax amount to be exempted or offset for the current period </p>
<p>A. if the excess VAT paid of the end for the current period ≤ The amount of tax to be exempted, offset or refunded for the current period, then </p>
<p>The amount of tax to be refunded for the current period = The excess VAT paid of the end for the current period</p>
<p>The amount of tax to be exempted or offset for the current period = The amount of tax to be exempted, offset or refunded for the current period - The amount of tax to be refunded for the current period </p>
<p>B. if the excess VAT paid of the end for the current period &gt; the amount of tax to be exempted, offset or refunded, then </p>
<p>The amount of tax to be refunded for the current period = The amount of tax to be exempted, offset or refunded for the current period </p>
<p>The amount of tax to be exempted or offset for the current period = 0 </p>
<p>The excess VAT paid of the end for the current period shall be determined according to the "excess VAT paid of the end of the period" in the VAT Return.</p>
<p>(4) Price of tax-free purchased raw materials for the current period includes the price of tax-free raw materials purchased within China with no input tax amount and with no need to withdraw input tax amount for the current period and the price of the bonded imported materials and parts processed with imported materials for the current period. The price of the bonded imported materials and parts processed with imported materials for the current period shall be the composite taxable price.</p>
<p>The composite taxable price of the bonded imported materials and parts processed with imported materials for the current period = CIF price of the imported materials and parts for the current period Tariff collected by the Customs Consumption tax collected by the Customs. </p>
<p>A. Where the actual consumption method is applied, the composite taxable price of the bonded imported materials and parts processed with imported materials for the current period shall be the composite taxable price of the imported materials and parts consumed for exported goods processed with imported materials for the current period. The calculation formula is as below, </p>
<p>The composite taxable price of the bonded imported materials and parts processed with imported materials for the current period = FOB price of the exported goods processed with imported materials for the current period × RMB conversion rate × Expected allocation rate</p>
<p>Expected allocation rate = Total value of expected import ? Total value of expected export × 100% </p>
<p>The manufacturing enterprises applying paper manuals and electronic manuals shall, according to the total value of the expected import and export as listed in the processing trade manual or electronic processing trade paper document issued by the Customs, calculate the expected allocation rate. </p>
<p>For the manufacturing enterprises applying electronic account, the expected allocation rate shall be determined on the basis of the actual allocation rate that has been verified and written off at the previous period. For the manufacturing enterprises that just started applying electronic account, the expected allocation rate shall be determined on the basis of the actual allocation rate in the paper manuals and electronic manuals that has been verified and written off at the previous period.</p>
<p>B. Where the purchased materials-based method is applied, the composite taxable price of the bonded imported materials and parts processed with imported materials for the current period shall be the composite taxable price of the actually purchased imported materials and parts processed with imported materials for the current period.</p>
<p>If the actual deductible amount of the tax which may not be exempted or offset for the current period is higher than "FOB Price of exported goods for the current period × RMB conversion rate × (Applicable tax rate of exported goods – Tax refund rate of exported goods)", then </p>
<p>The deductible amount for the tax which may not be exempted or offset for the current period = FOB price of exported goods for the current period × RMB conversion rate × (Applicable tax rate of exported goods – Tax refund rate of exported goods). </p>
<ol>
<li>VAT exemption and refund of the goods and services exported by foreign trade enterprises shall be calculated according to the following formula, </li>
</ol>
<p>(1) Goods other than the goods under commissioned processing, repair and fitting exported by the foreign trade enterprises, </p>
<p>The amount of VAT to be refunded for the current period = Taxable price of VAT refund (exemption) × Tax refund rate of exported goods </p>
<p>(2) Goods under commissioned processing, repair and fitting exported by foreign trade enterprises,</p>
<p>The amount of VAT to be refunded for the export of the goods under commissioned processing, repair and fitting = Taxable price of VAT refund (exemption) of the commissioned processing, repair and fitting × Tax refund rate of exported goods</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Where the tax refund rate is lower than the applicable tax rate, the corresponding differential sum calculated shall be included into the cost of the exported goods and services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where the export enterprise has VAT exemption, offset or refund items and VAT levy and refund, refund after collection items, VAT levy and refund, refund after collection items shall not be calculated into export VAT exemption, offset or refund items. The export enterprise shall separately calculate VAT exemption, offset or refund items and VAT levy and refund, refund after collection items, and separately apply for VAT levy and refund, refund after collection policies and VAT exemption, offset or refund policies.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Where it is unable to separate the input tax amount used for VAT levy and refund item or refund after collection item, the following formula shall apply,</p>
<p>The part of input tax amount used for VAT levy and refund item or VAT refund after collection item that is unable to be separated = Total input tax amount unable to be separated for the current month × Sales amount of VAT levy and refund item or refund after collection item for the current month ? Sum of total sales amount and turnover for the current month</p>
