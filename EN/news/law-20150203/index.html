                <p>Announcement of the State Administration of Taxation on Several Issues concerning the Enterprise Income Tax on the Indirect Transfers of Properties by Non-Resident Enterprises</p>
<p>Announcement of the State Administration of Taxation [2015] No.7</p>
<p>February 3, 2015</p>
<p>In order to further standardize and strengthen the administration of enterprise income tax on indirect transfers of equities and other properties of Chinese resident enterprises by non-resident enterprises and in accordance with the Law of the People's Republic of China on Enterprise Income Tax (hereinafter referred to as the "Enterprise Income Tax Law") and its implementing regulations (hereinafter referred to as the "Implementing Regulations of the Enterprise Income Tax Law"), as well as the Law of the People's Republic of China on the Administration of Tax Levying (hereinafter referred to as the "Tax Levying Law") and its implementing rules, the relevant issues are hereby notified as follows:</p>
<p>Article 1 Where a non-resident enterprise indirectly transfers equities and other properties of a Chinese resident enterprise to evade its obligation of paying enterprise income tax by implementing arrangements that are not for bona fide commercial purpose, such indirect transfer shall, in accordance with the provisions of Article 47 of the Enterprise Income Tax Law, be re-identified and recognized as a direct transfer of equities and other properties of the Chinese resident enterprise.</p>
<p>For the purpose of the Announcement of the State Administration of Taxation on Several Issues concerning the Enterprise Income Tax on the Indirect Transfers of Properties by Non-Resident Enterprises (hereinafter referred to as the "Announcement"), "equities and other properties of Chinese resident enterprises" refer to properties of branches or establishments within the territory of China, real estate located within the territory of China and equity investment assets of Chinese resident enterprises which are directly held by non-resident enterprises and for which the proceeds from transfers are subject to payment of enterprise income tax in China according to the provisions of Chinese tax laws (hereinafter referred to as the "Chinese taxable properties").</p>
<p>The indirect transfer of Chinese taxable property refers to the transaction which produces a result identical or similar substantially to direct transfer of Chinese taxable property by a non-resident enterprise through transfer of equities and other similar interests (hereinafter referred to as the "equities") of foreign enterprises directly or indirectly holding Chinese taxable properties (excluding Chinese resident enterprises registered outside China, and hereinafter referred to as the "foreign enterprises"), including the circumstances under which changes in foreign enterprises' shareholders due to restructuring of the non-resident enterprise occur. A non-resident enterprise indirectly transferring Chinese taxable property is known as an equity transferor.</p>
<p>Article 2 For the amount of proceeds acquired by an equity transferor as provided in Article 1 hereof from its transfer of foreign enterprise equities and included in the item of Chinese taxable property (hereinafter referred to as the "proceeds from indirect transfer of Chinese taxable property"), the tax treatment should be carried out in the following order:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>the amount of property that belongs to the branch or establishment set up by a foreign enterprise or its subsidiary directly or indirectly holding Chinese taxable property (hereinafter referred to as the "proceeds from indirect transfer of property of branch or establishment") should be identified as the proceeds with real relation to such branch or establishment and shall be taxed according to the provisions of Paragraph 2 of Article 3 of the Enterprise Income Tax Law;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>except for the circumstance as provided in Item 1 of the present article, the amount of real estate located within the territory of China (hereinafter referred to as the "proceeds from indirect transfer of real estate") should be treated as the proceeds from transfer of real estate located within the territory of China and taxed according to Paragraph 3 of Article 3 of the Enterprise Income Tax Law; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>except for the circumstances as provided in Items 1 and 2 of the present article, the amount of equity investment assets of a Chinese resident enterprise (hereinafter referred to as the "proceeds from indirect transfer of equities") should be treated as the proceeds from transfer of equity investment assets within territory of China and taxed according to Paragraph 3 of Article 3 of the Enterprise Income Tax Law.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Article 3 To determine whether the transfer is for bona fide commercial purpose, an overall consideration shall be given to all arrangements relevant to the indirect transfer of Chinese taxable property, and a comprehensive analysis on the following relevant factors shall be made in combination with the practical situations:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>whether the main value of foreign enterprise equities is directly or indirectly generated from the Chinese taxable property;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>whether the foreign enterprise assets mainly consist of direct or indirect investments made within the territory of China, or whether the main income obtained is directly or indirectly from China;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>whether the functions actually performed by and the risks undertaken by a foreign enterprise and its subsidiary directly or indirectly holding Chinese taxable property can confirm that the enterprise structure is of economic substance;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>duration of shareholders, business modes and related organizational structure of the foreign enterprise;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>information about the payment of due income tax outside China on indirect transfer of Chinese taxable property;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the substitutability of indirect investment by equity transferor, indirect transfer of Chinese taxable property and direct investment, and direct transfer of Chinese taxable property;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chinese tax conventions or arrangement applicable to the proceeds from indirect transfer of Chinese taxable property; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>other relevant factors.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Article 4 Except for the circumstances as provided in Articles 5 and 6, the overall arrangement in relation to indirect transfer of Chinese taxable property, if simultaneously meeting the following conditions, may need no analysis and judgment according to Article 3 hereof and shall be directly identified as having no bona fide commercial purpose:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>more than 75% of the value of foreign enterprise equities is directly or indirectly generated from the Chinese taxable property;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in any time of the year prior to indirect transfer of Chinese taxable property, more than 90% of the total assets (excluding cash) of foreign enterprise is directly or indirectly formed by the investments in China; or within the year prior to indirect transfer of Chinese taxable property, more than 90% of the income obtained by foreign enterprise is directly or indirectly generated within the territory of China;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>although the foreign enterprise and its subsidiary directly or indirectly holding Chinese taxable property has registered in the country (region) where they are located in order to have the organizational form as required by law, the function they actually perform and the risks they undertake are too limited to prove the existence of their economic substance; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the tax on indirect transfer of Chinese taxable property that should be collected outside China is less than the possible tax on direct transfer of Chinese taxable property in China.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Article 5 Article 1 hereof shall not apply to the overall arrangements that are in relation to indirect transfer of Chinese taxable property and meet any of the following circumstances:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>a non-resident enterprise buys and sells equity of the same listed foreign enterprise in the open market and obtains the proceeds from indirect transfer of Chinese taxable property; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>under the circumstance that a non-resident enterprise directly hold and transfer Chinese taxable property, the proceeds from transfer of such property can be exempted from enterprise income tax in China in accordance with the applicable provisions of tax conventions or arrangements.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Article 6 Any indirect transfer of Chinese taxable property shall be recognized as having a bona fide commercial purpose when it meets the following conditions simultaneously:</p>
<ol>
<li>the transaction parties are in any of the following equity relations:</li>
</ol>
<p>(1) the equity transferor holds, directly or indirectly, more than 80% of the transferee's equity;</p>
<p>(2) the equity transferee holds, directly or indirectly, more than 80% of the transferor's equity; or</p>
<p>(3) more than 80% of the equity of the transferee and transferor is held, directly or indirectly, by the same party.</p>
<p>Where more than 50% (exclusive) of the value of foreign enterprise equities is directly or indirectly generated from real estate in China, the shareholding ratio stated in Sub-items 1 to 3 of Item 1 of the present article should be 100%.</p>
<p>The aforesaid equity that is indirectly held shall be calculated according to the product of shareholding ratios of all enterprises in the shareholding chain.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>for the second indirect transfer incurred after this indirect transfer, the Chinese income tax on it will not be less than the tax on the same or similar indirect transfer incurred when there is no such first indirect transfer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the equity transferee pays all the equity transaction consideration with the equities of its enterprise or the enterprise to which it has shareholding relation (excluding equities of a listed company).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Article 7 Where the proceeds from indirect transfer of property of branch or establishment are subject to enterprise income tax, they shall be included in such branch or establishment's proceeds for the corresponding tax year in which the day when the tax payment obligation comes into being and declared for payment of enterprise income tax in accordance with relevant provisions.</p>
<p>Article 8 Where the proceeds from indirect transfer of real estate or equities are subject to enterprise income tax according to the provisions hereof, the entity or individual that has the direct liability for the relevant payment obligation to the equity transferor according to the relevant laws and regulations or contracts shall be identified as the withholding agent.</p>
<p>Where the withholding agent fails to withhold the tax due or withhold the tax due in full, the equity transferor shall declare to the competent tax authority for payment of such tax within seven days after the tax payment obligation comes into being, and shall provide information relevant to the calculation of equity transfer income and tax. The competent tax authority shall report upwards level by level to the State Administration of Taxation for record-filing within 30 days after the inclusion of the relevant tax into the treasury.</p>
<p>If the withholding agent fails to withhold and the equity transferor fails to pay the tax due, the competent tax authority may investigate the withholding agent's liabilities in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Tax Levying Law and its implementing rules; however, where the withholding agent has submitted the information according to Article 9 hereof within 30 days upon the conclusion of the equity transfer contract or agreement, the said liabilities may be relieved or exempted.</p>
<p>Article 9 The parties to an indirect transfer of Chinese taxable property and the Chinese resident enterprises whose equity is transferred may report matters relating to the equity transfer to the competent tax authority and submit the following materials:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>the equity transfer contract or agreement (plus a Chinese version if it is stated in foreign language, hereinafter the same);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the enterprise's equity structure diagrams before and after the equity transfer;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the financial or accounting statements for the last two years of the foreign enterprise and its subsidiary directly or indirectly holding Chinese taxable property; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the reason why Article 1 hereof is not applicable to the indirect transfer of Chinese taxable property.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Article 10 Parties making and planning the indirect transfer of Chinese taxable property and the Chinese resident enterprise whose equity is indirectly transferred shall provide the following materials according to the requirements of the competent tax authority:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>the materials as provided in Article 9 hereof (excluded those submitted);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>decisions related to overall arrangements of indirect transfer of Chinese taxable property and information about the implementation of such decisions;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>information about the foreign enterprise and its subsidiary directly or indirectly holding Chinese taxable property in respects of production or operation, personnel, finance and property, as well as internal and external audit;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>asset appraisal report made for the purpose of determining the transfer price of foreign equities, and other price basis;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>information about the payment of income tax outside China on indirect transfer of Chinese taxable property;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evidence relevant to the application of Articles 5 and 6 hereof; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>any other relevant materials.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Article 11 Where the competent tax authority needs to file a case to investigate and adjust the indirect transfer of Chinese taxable property, the relevant provisions on general anti-avoidance shall be applied.</p>
<p>Article 12 Where an equity transferor directly transfers the foreign enterprise equities, which leads to indirect transfer of more than two Chinese taxable properties, taxes shall be levied according to the provisions hereof; and if more than two competent tax authorities are involved, the equity transferor shall respectively declare to them the payment of enterprise income tax.</p>
<p>The competent tax authorities shall inform each other of the tax calculation method and put the tax payment into treasury after reaching a consensus; however, if no consensus is reached, they shall report to their common tax authority at the next higher level for coordination.</p>
<p>Article 13 Where an equity transferor fails to declare for payment timely or in full of the tax due on proceeds from indirect transfer of Chinese taxable property and the withholding agent also fails to withhold such tax, the tax authority shall, in addition to supplementary collection of such tax, also charge for interest on a daily basis from the equity transferor according to provisions of Articles 121 and 122 of the Implementing Regulations of the Enterprise Income Tax Law.</p>
<p>Where an equity transferor provides materials as specified in Article 9 hereof within 30 days upon the conclusion of foreign enterprise equity transfer contract or agreement or declares tax payment in accordance with the provisions of Articles 7 and 8 hereof, the interest shall be calculated according to the benchmark interest rate as provided in Article 122 of the Implementing Regulations of the Enterprise Income Tax Law; where the materials are not provided or the tax is not declared and paid according to the provisions, the interest shall be calculated at a benchmark rate plus five percentage points.</p>
<p>Article 14 The Circular applies to the proceeds from indirect transfer of Chinese taxable property that are received by non-resident enterprises having no branch or establishment in China, as well as the proceeds from indirect transfer of Chinese taxable property that are received by non-resident enterprises having branches or establishments in China but having no real relation to them.</p>
<p>Where the proceeds from an equity transferor's transfer of foreign enterprise equities (including the proceeds from indirect transfer of Chinese taxable property) are in real relation to the domestic branches or establishments set up thereby, the relevant tax may be levied directly according to provisions of Paragraph 2 of Article 3 of the Enterprise Income Tax Law rather than provisions of the Announcement.</p>
<p>Article 15 For the purpose of the Announcement, "the day when the tax payment obligation comes into being" refers to the day when the equity transfer contract or agreement enters into force and the foreign enterprise completes its change in shareholding.</p>
<p>Article 16 For the purpose of the Announcement, "the competent tax authority" refers to the tax authority that collects enterprise income tax on property transfer when any Chinese taxable property is directly held and transferred by a non-resident enterprise. The competent tax authority shall collect the tax respectively according to the three circumstances specified in Article 2 hereof.</p>
<p>Article 17 For the purpose of the Announcement, "more than" shall include the following given figures unless otherwise stated.</p>
<p>Article 18 Where there is any inconsistency between the provisions of the Announcement and tax conventions, the latter shall prevail.</p>
<p>Article 19 The Announcement shall take effect as of the date of promulgation. The Announcement shall apply to matters that occur before the promulgation of the Announcement and have not undergone tax treatment. The relevant contents specified in Articles 5 and 6 of the Circular of the State Administration of Taxation on Strengthening the Administration of Enterprise Income Tax on Incomes from Equity Transfers of Non-resident Enterprises (Guo Shui Han [2009] No.698) and Items 3 to 5 of Article 6 of the Announcement of the State Administration of Taxation on Several Issues concerning the Administration of Income Tax on Non-Resident Enterprises (Announcement of the State Administration of Taxation [2011] No.24) shall be repealed simultaneously.</p>
<p>It is hereby announced.</p>
