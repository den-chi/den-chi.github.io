                <p>Announcement of the State Administration of Taxation on Issues concerning the Simplification of the Procedures for the Receiving and Use of Value-added Tax Invoices</p>
<p>Announcement of the State Administration of Taxation 2014 No. 19</p>
<p>March 24, 2014</p>
<p>In order to practically transform the work functions of taxation authorities, further improve tax collection services and raise the efficiency of handling taxation matters, the State Administration of Taxation has launched the "Project of Facilitating the People in Processing Taxation Matters" to comprehensively speed up the entire process of handling taxation matters and facilitate the tax experience of honest and law-abiding taxpayers. This Announcement is hereby made on issues concerning the simplification of the procedures for the receipt and use of value-added tax ("VAT") invoices:</p>
<p>Article 1 Simplify the formalities that apply to taxpayers in respect of the receipt and use of VAT invoices</p>
<p>The requirement for manual verification of used VAT invoices (including special VAT invoices, freight industry special VAT invoices, ordinary VAT invoices, and uniform motor vehicle sales invoices, hereinafter the same) is abolished. Taxation authorities shall use the tax filing data in the ordinary VAT taxpayer (hereinafter referred to as the "Ordinary Taxpayer") invoice tax control system to verify used VAT invoices electronically.</p>
<p>Article 2 Simplify the examination and approval formalities for special invoices</p>
<p>Responsible taxation authorities are not required to conduct on-site inspections in advance where Ordinary Taxpayers apply for special invoices (including special VAT invoices and freight industry special VAT invoices, hereinafter the same) whose invoicing amount does not exceed CNY 100,000. Offices of the State Administration of Taxation ("SAT") in all provinces may, on this basis, appropriately expand the scope of the measures that exempt advance on-site inspection, and the scope and methods of on-site inspections shall be determined by the offices of the SAT in all provinces.</p>
<p>Article 3 Simplify the process for handling lost special invoices</p>
<p>Where an Ordinary Taxpayer loses both the invoice stub and the deduction stub of a special invoice that has already been issued, if before the loss it had already been matched to the relevant transaction, the purchaser concerned may use a photocopy of the bookkeeping stub of the matched special invoice provided by the seller and the Proof of Tax Filing by Lost Special Value-added Tax Invoices or Proof of Tax Filing by Lost Freight Industry Special Value-added Tax Special Invoices (See Appendix 1 or Appendix 2, hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Proof") issued by the responsible taxation authority of the seller as the certificates for deduction of VAT input tax. If matching did not occur before the loss, the purchaser may use a photocopy of the bookkeeping stub of the corresponding special invoice provided by the seller to conduct confirmation, and where confirmation is successful, the seller may use a photocopy of the bookkeeping stub of the special invoice and the Proof issued by the responsible taxation authority of the seller as the certificates for deduction of VAT input tax. In either case, the photocopy of the bookkeeping stub of the special invoice and the Proof shall be retained for future reference.</p>
<p>Where an Ordinary Taxpayer loses the deduction stub of a special invoice that has already been issued, if before the loss the special invoice had already been matched to the relevant transaction, the photocopy of the invoice stub of the special invoice may be retained for future reference; otherwise, the Ordinary Taxpayer may use the invoice stub of the special invoice to conduct confirmation, and retain the photocopy thereof for future reference. </p>
<p>Where an Ordinary Taxpayer loses the invoice stub of a special invoice that has already been issued, the deduction stub of the special invoice may be used as the bookkeeping certificate, and a photocopy of the deduction stub of the special invoice shall be retained for future reference.</p>
<p>Article 4 Simplify the formalities for special credit memos</p>
<p>Where after issuing a special invoice, the relevant Ordinary Taxpayer issues a special credit memo for the goods are returned or a partial sales refund given, the Ordinary Taxpayer is not required to lodge a photocopy of the corresponding bookkeeping certificate of the transaction with the responsible taxation authority for record-filing.</p>
<p>Article 5 Carry out classified, hierarchical and standardized administration</p>
<p>Classified, hierarchical and standardized administration shall be carried out with regard to VAT invoices, so as to improve work efficiency and reduce the number of steps in tax administration.</p>
<ol>
<li>A taxpayer who falls under any of the following circumstances may collect special VAT invoices not in excess of the pieces needed for three months' of use on a single occasion, and where the taxpayer needs to adjust the number of VAT invoices needed and all required formalities have been completed, the adjustment shall immediately be processed as required by the taxpayer:</li>
</ol>
<p>(1) The taxpayer's credit rating for tax payment is assessed as "A"; or</p>
<p>(2) An office of the SAT at the level of prefectural cities confirms that the taxpayer otherwise has a good credit standing for tax payment and a lower level of tax collection risks.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Where the above-mentioned taxpayer is involved in any breach of the taxation laws within two years, or becomes subject to a formal judicial process by juridical organs, or is subject to an ongoing investigation in respect of a case filed by taxation authorities, Item 1 of this Article shall not apply.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Administrative work in respect of the limits on the quantity and total invoicing amount of special invoices that can be issued by an Ordinary Taxpayer during the guidance period shall be handled according to the relevant provisions of the Measures for Administration of General Taxpayers of Value-added Tax in Tax Training Period.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Article 6 Establish highly effectively and interlinked risk prevention and control systems </p>
<p>In the course of delivering tax administration services of the appropriate standards and raising the tax administration efficiency, taxation authorities shall fully utilize technological measures to establish highly effective and interlinked risk prevention and control systems, set risk prevention and control metrics based in a scientific manner to strengthen both daily assessment and follow-up monitoring and management, and upgrade both the timeliness and targeted nature of follow-up monitoring to track and analyze the invoice usage and tax filing by taxpayers. Where the invoice usage of a taxpayer is abnormal and the taxpayer lacks a proper basis, the relevant taxation authority may re-examine the invoicing quantum limits on invoices and invoice quantities.</p>
<p>This Announcement shall take effect from May 1, 2014. Article 28 of the Circular of the State Administration of Taxation on Revising the Provisions on the Use of Special Invoices for Value-Added Tax (Guo Shui Fa [2006] No. 156), Item (5) of Article 1 of the Supplementary Circular of the State Administration of Taxation on Revising the Provisions on the Use of Special Invoices for Value-added Tax (Guo Shui Fa [2007] No. 18), Article 2 of the Circular of the State Administration of Taxation on Transferring the Examination and Approval Power for the Upper Billing Limit of Special Value-added Tax Invoices to the Lower Level Authorities (Guo Shui Han [2007] No. 918) and Item (4) of Article 5 of the Announcement of the State Administration of Taxation of Issues Concerning Administration on Nationwide Pilot Collection of Value-Added Tax in Lieu of Business Tax (Announcement of the State Administration of Taxation 2013 No. 39) shall be simultaneously repealed. </p>
<p>This Announcement is hereby given.</p>
