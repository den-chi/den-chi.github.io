                <p>Announcement of the State Administration of Taxation on Strengthening the Follow-up Administration Following the Cancellation of the Examination and Approval Process for Three Matters concerning Enterprise Income Tax</p>
<p>Announcement of the State Administration of Taxation [2015] No.6</p>
<p>February 2, 2005</p>
<p>In accordance with the provisions specified in the Decision of the State Council on Matters relating to Cancelling and Adjusting a Batch of Administrative Examination and Approval Items (Guo Fa [2014] No.27 and Guo Fa [2014] No.50), the "verification progress for enjoyment of the preferential enterprise income tax policies for small-sized and meager-profit enterprises", "examination progress for record-filing of list of branches at the second level or below of an enterprise whose revenue totally belongs to the Central Government", "examination progress for changes in the organizational structure of an enterprise paying taxes in a consolidated manner" and other items are cancelled, and issues concerning the follow-up administration of enterprise income tax are hereby announced as follows:</p>
<p>Article 1 Further Simplify the Formalities for Filing of Preferential Policies on Enterprise Income Tax for Small-sized and Meager-profit Enterprises</p>
<p>When handling the final settlement of enterprise income taxes incurred in 2014 and subsequent years, the small-sized and meager-profit enterprises subject to tax collection upon verification shall go through the formalities for filing by filling in the columns "104 Number of Employees" and "105 Total Assets (CNY'0,000)" in the Basic Information Form (Table No.A000000), which is provided for by the Announcement of the State Administration of Taxation on Promulgating the Annual Enterprise Income Tax Return of the People's Republic of China (Category A, 2014 Edition) (Announcement of the State Administration of Taxation [2014] No.63) and do not need to conduct filing separately.</p>
<p>Article 2 Cancel the Follow-up Administration of "Examination Progress for Record-filing of List of Branches at the Second Level or Below of An Enterprise Whose Revenue Totally Belongs to the Central Government"</p>
<p>Where there are any changes in the list of branches at the second level or below of an enterprise whose revenue totally belongs to the Central Government (referred to as the "Central Enterprise" in the present article), the relevant materials shall be submitted to the corresponding competent taxation authorities in accordance with the following provisions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>where there are any changes in the list of branches at the second level of a Central Enterprise, the headquarters of the Central Enterprise shall report the situation after the adjustment and the changes in the branches to the competent taxation authority.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>where a Central Enterprise establishes a branch at the second level or below, the branch at the second level shall submit to its competent taxation authority its business license and the certificate issued by the headquarters which proves that it is a branch at the second level or below as attachments to the declaration form for prepayment of enterprise income tax.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A newly established branch at the third level or below shall submit to its competent taxation authority its business license and the certificate issued by the headquarters which proves that it is a branch at the third level or below.</p>
<ol>
<li>where a Central Enterprise closes (deregisters) a branch at second level or below, the branch closed shall, in accordance with the provisions as provided for by the Law of the People's Republic of China on the Administration of Tax Levying, handle the deregistration procedures. The branch at the second level shall report the closing (deregistration) of the branch at the second level or below to its competent taxation authority.</li>
</ol>
<p>The competent taxation authority shall, according to the information on the filing of changes in the branches at the second level or below of Central Enterprises, adjust and enrich the information on tax levying in a timely manner.</p>
<p>Article 3 Cancel the Follow-up Administration after the Cancellation of "Examination Progress for Changes in the Organizational Structure of an Enterprise Paying Taxes in a Consolidated Manner"</p>
<p>Where an enterprise paying taxes in a consolidated manner changes its organizational structure, its headquarters and the relevant branch at the second level shall, within 30 days as of the changes of the organizational structure, report the changes in the organizational structure to the competent taxation authority. The provincial-level taxation administration of the place where the headquarters is located shall, in accordance with the Article 29 of the Announcement of the State Administration of Taxation on Issuing the Measures for the Collection and Administration of Income Tax on Enterprises That Have Operations in Different Regions and Pay Taxes in a Consolidated Manner (Announcement of the State Administration of Taxation [2012] No.57), upload the information on the changes in the organizational structure of the enterprise paying taxes in a consolidated manner to the system for administration of information on payment of enterprise income tax in a consolidated manner.</p>
<p>"Where the organizational structure of the enterprise paying taxes in a consolidated manner is changed in a subsequent year, the branch shall provide relevant certification materials in accordance with Article 23 of these Measures to the local taxation authority in the place where the branch is located for re-assessment of the status of the branch" as prescribed in Paragraph 3 of Article 24 of the Announcement of the State Administration of Taxation [2012] No.57 shall be annulled.</p>
<p>Article 4 Except for Article 1, the Announcement of the State Administration of Taxation on Strengthening the Follow-up Administration Following the Cancellation of the Examination and Approval Process for Three Matters concerning Enterprise Income Tax shall take effect as of January 1, 2015.</p>
<p>It is hereby announced.</p>
<p>Interpretation on the Announcement on Issues concerning the Follow-up Administration Following the Cancellation of the Examination and Approval Process for Three Matters concerning Enterprise Income Tax</p>
<p>Recently, the State Administration of Taxation has issued the Announcement on Issues concerning the Follow-up Administration Following the Cancellation of the Examination and Approval Process for Three Matters concerning Enterprise Income Tax (Announcement of the State Administration of Taxation [2015] No.6) so as to seriously implement the work related to cancellation of the examination and approval progress for matters concerning enterprise income tax, enhance the follow-up administration and facilitate the tax collector and payer's study and specific operation, which is hereby interpreted as follows:</p>
<p>Article 1 The Necessity for Issuance of the Announcement on Issues concerning the Follow-up Administration Following the Cancellation of the Examination and Approval Process for Three Matters concerning Enterprise Income Tax (hereinafter referred to as the "Announcement")</p>
<p>The first is to seriously implement the work related to the cancellation of administrative examination and approval items concerning income tax and to further strengthen the follow-up administration.</p>
<p>In accordance with the united requirement of the State Council for the administrative examination and approval reform, that is, "delegating all the powers that shall be delegated to lower levels and effectively administrating all the matters that must be administrated", the Opinions of the State Administration of Taxation on Several Issues concerning the Reform of Tax Administrative Approval System (Shui Zong Fa [2014] No.107) clearly set the task of "pursuing an integration of delegation and control and strengthening the interim and ex post administration". The cancellation of administrative examination and approval progress for certain items does not mean that the reform shall end with delegation of powers, and the working focus shall timely shift to the follow-up administration. In 2014, the State Council successively issued the Decision of the State Council on Matters relating to Cancelling and Adjusting a Batch of Administrative Examination and Approval Items (Guo Fa [2014] No.27 and Guo Fa [2014] No.50) and other documents, which cancel the examination and approval process for three matters concerning enterprise income tax, namely "verification progress for enjoyment of the preferential enterprise income tax policies for small-sized and meager-profit enterprises", "examination progress for changes in the organizational structure of an enterprise paying taxes in a consolidated manner" and "examination progress for record-filing of list of branches at the second level or below of an enterprise whose revenue totally belongs to the Central Government". The follow-up administration of these three items shall be tracked in a timely manner, and, if necessary, an document may be issued for confirmation.</p>
<p>The second is to actively cooperate with the implementation of standards for tax levying and administration, and tax services and to effectively protect the legitimate rights and interests of taxpayers.</p>
<p>In recent years, the State Council successively cancels the examination and approval progress for matters concerning taxation, which has a positive significance for the release of reform's benefits, reduction of the burdens of handling of taxation affairs and protection of legitimate rights and interests of taxpayers. In 2014, the taxation system, according to the guideline of "Spring Wind Activity for the Convenience of Citizens in Handling Taxation Affairs", concentrates efforts to carry out the study, drafting and promulgation of the standards for tax payment services and tax levying and administration, and other relevant work. The administration of the examination and approval progress for the above three matters concerning enterprise income tax and the follow-up administration work after the cancellation of the examination and approval process shall be subject to the standards for tax payment services, and tax levying and administration. After the State Council announced to cancel the examination and approval progress for the three matters concerning enterprise income tax, it is necessary to timely launch the regulations on follow-up administration, further enrich, perfect and revise the relevant provisions on the standards for tax payment services and tax levying and administration, unify the actual operation caliber of each taxation authority at the provincial or city level and effectively protect the legitimate rights and interests of taxpayers.</p>
<p>Article 2 The Regulations on the Follow-up Administration Related to the Cancellation of the Examination and Approval Process</p>
<ol>
<li>Further simplify the formalities for filing of preferential policies on the enterprise income tax for small-sized and meager-profit enterprises subject to tax collection upon verification</li>
</ol>
<p>As specified in the Announcement of the State Administration of Taxation on Issues concerning Expanding the Scope of Small-sized and Meager-profit Enterprises Subject to Half-reduced Enterprise Income Tax (Announcement of the State Administration of Taxation [2014] No.23), a small-sized and meager-profit enterprise may enjoy the preferential policies at its sole discretion without obtaining the approval of the relevant tax authority upon examination when the enterprise income tax is prepaid; however, it shall report to the taxation authority the information on its employees and total assets for filing at the same time as it submits the annual enterprise income tax return.</p>
<p>At the end of last year, the State Administration of Taxation issued the Announcement of the State Administration of Taxation on Promulgating the Annual Enterprise Income Tax Return of the People's Republic of China (Category A, 2014 Edition) (Announcement of the State Administration of Taxation [2014] No.63). The Basic Information Form (Table No.A000000) as set out therein may ask an enterprise to fill in the corresponding columns with the information on "Number of Employees" and "Total Assets", based on which, the taxation authority may further simplify the follow-up administration. Under such circumstances, when handling the final settlement of enterprise income taxes, the small-sized and meager-profit enterprises subject to tax collection upon verification shall go through the formalities for filing by filling in the corresponding columns as set in the Basic Information Form (Table No.A000000), and do not need to conduct filing separately. As for the small-sized and meager-profit enterprises subject to tax collection upon verification, because their Declaration Form for Payment of Enterprise Income Tax fails to reflect the information on "number of employees and total assets", the filing shall still be conducted temporarily according to the existing provisions. The State Administration of Taxation shall start the work related to verification of revision of the Declaration Form for Enterprise Income Tax Quarterly Prepaid by an Enterprise, and then may simplify the corresponding filing formalities.</p>
<ol>
<li>Issues on the follow-up administration following the cancellation of "examination progress for record-filing of list of branches at the second level or below of an enterprise whose revenue totally belongs to the Central Government"</li>
</ol>
<p>According to the Decision of the State Council on Matters relating to Cancelling and Adjusting a Batch of Administrative Examination and Approval Items (Guo Fa [2014] No.50), the item "examination progress for record-filing of list of branches at the second level or below of an enterprise whose revenue totally belongs to the Central Government (referred to as the "Central Enterprise" in the present article)" has been cancelled.</p>
<p>After the cancellation of the examination and approval progress, where there are any changes in the list of branches at the second level or below of an enterprise whose revenue totally belongs to the Central Government (hereinafter referred to as the "Central Enterprise" in the present article), the relevant materials shall be submitted to the corresponding competent taxation authorities in accordance with the following provisions:</p>
<p>Firstly, where there are any changes in the list of branches at the second level of a Central Enterprise, the headquarters of the Central Enterprise shall report the situation after the adjustment and the changes in the branches to the competent taxation authority.</p>
<p>Secondly, where a Central Enterprise establishes a branch at the second level or below, the branch at the second level shall submit to its competent taxation authority its business license and the certificate issued by the headquarters which proves that it is a branch at the second level or below as attachments to the Application Form for Prepayment of Enterprise Income Tax.</p>
<p>A newly established branch at the third level or below shall submit to its competent taxation authority its business license and the certificate issued by the headquarters which proves that it is a branch at the third level or below.</p>
<p>Thirdly, where a Central Enterprise closes (deregisters) a branch at second level or below, the branch closed shall, in accordance with the provisions as provided for by the Law of the People's Republic of China on the Administration of Tax Levying, handle the deregistration procedures. The branch at the second level shall report the closing (deregistration) of the branch at the second level or below to its competent taxation authority.</p>
<p>The competent taxation authority shall, according to the information on the filing of changes in the branches at the second level or below of a Central Enterprise, adjust and enrich the information on tax levying in a timely manner.</p>
<ol>
<li>Issues on the follow-up administration following the cancellation of "examination process for changes in the organizational structure of an enterprise paying taxes in a consolidated manner"</li>
</ol>
<p>In the past, where an enterprise paying taxes in a consolidated manner changes its organizational structure, its headquarters and the relevant branch at the second level shall timely report the changes in the organizational structure to the competent taxation authority for examination and appraisal. After the cancellation of the examination and approval progress, the taxation authority shall enhance the follow-up administration from two aspects: firstly, the headquarters and the relevant branch shall, within 30 days, report the changes in the organizational structure to the competent taxation authority; secondly, the provincial-level taxation administration of the place where the headquarters is located shall upload the information on the changes in the organizational structure of the enterprise paying taxes in a consolidated manner to the system for administration of information on payment of enterprise income tax in a consolidated manner so as to facilitate the information comparison by the taxation authority.</p>
<p>Article 3 Issues on the Implementation Date of the Announcement</p>
<p>The simplified formalities for filing by small-sized and meager-profit enterprises subject to tax collection upon verification shall apply to the final settlement of enterprise income taxes incurred in 2014 and subsequent years. The provisions on the follow-up administration following the cancellation of the "examination progress for record-filing of list of branches at the second level or below of an enterprise whose revenue totally belongs to the Central Government" and the "examination progress for changes in the organizational structure of an enterprise paying taxes in a consolidated manner" shall take effect as of January 1, 2015.</p>
