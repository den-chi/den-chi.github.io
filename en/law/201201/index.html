                <p>Announcement of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, the General Administration of Customs and the State Administration of Taxation Concerning the Reform of the Foreign Exchange Administration System for Trade in Goods</p>
<p>Announcement of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, the General Administration of Customs and the State Administration of Taxation [2012] No. 1</p>
<p>June 27, 2012</p>
<p>For the purpose of vigorously facilitating the trade and further improving foreign exchange services and administration for trade in goods, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, General Administration of Customs and State Administration of Taxation decide to reform the foreign exchange administration system for trade in goods, correspondingly adjust export declaration process, and optimize and upgrade the information sharing mechanism on foreign exchange proceeds from export and export tax refund as of August 1, 2012. Relevant issues are hereby announced as follows,</p>
<p>Article 1 Reform the foreign exchange administration mode in the trade in goods.</p>
<p>From the date of the reform, the verification and writing-off bill for foreign exchange proceeds from export (hereafter referred to as the "verification and write-off bill") shall be cancelled, and the enterprises are no longer required to handle the verification and writing-off procedure for foreign exchange proceeds from export. The branches and sub-branches of State Administration of Foreign Exchange (hereafter referred to as the "foreign exchange bureaus") shall change the administrative mode of trade-related foreign exchange of enterprises from the current on-site verification and writing-off on a deal-by-deal basis to off-site inspection of the total sum of foreign exchange of enterprises. Through the foreign exchange monitoring system for trade in goods, foreign exchange bureaus shall fully collect the information on the goods export and import, and the deal-by-deal foreign exchange revenue and payment of the trade, regularly compare and evaluate the overall correspondence between the enterprises' goods and capital flows, and facilitate the trade-related foreign exchange revenue and payment of compliance enterprises; and carry out intensive monitoring of enterprises with irregularities and conduct on-site inspections where it is necessary.</p>
<p>Article 2 Carry out dynamic and differentiated regulation of enterprises.</p>
<p>Foreign exchange bureaus shall classify the enterprises into three categories A, B, and C upon their compliance with regulation on trade-related foreign exchange revenue and payment and the consistency with the import and export of their goods. For Category A enterprises, the documents concerning foreign exchange payment from import shall be simplified, the foreign exchange payment may be handled directly with the banks on the strength of the Customs Declaration Form of Import, contract or invoice or other any document sufficiently proving the authenticity of the transactions involved, and no network-based verification is required for foreign exchange proceeds from exports; and the examination procedure for the foreign exchange proceeds and payment by banks shall be simplified correspondingly. For Category B and Category C enterprises, strict supervision shall be conducted over the examination of their foreign exchange revenue and payment in trade, the business type, the method of settlement and other aspects. The foreign exchange revenue and payment of Category B enterprises shall be reviewed by the banks on the basis of relevant electronic data and those of Category C enterprises shall be handled upon case-by-case registration by foreign exchange bureaus.</p>
<p>Foreign exchange bureaus shall dynamically adjust the categorization of enterprises on the basis of their compliance with foreign exchange administration provisions within the differentiated supervision period. A Category A enterprise that violates any of the rules on foreign exchange administration provisions shall be downgraded into a Category B or C enterprise. A Category B enterprise whose compliance with regulation doesn't turn better within the differentiated supervision period shall be subject to prolonged differentiated supervision period or shall be downgraded into a Category C enterprise. A Category B or C enterprise that fully complies with the regulatory rules in its business operation may be upgraded into a Category A enterprise upon the expiration of the differentiated supervision period.</p>
<p>Article 3 Adjust the export declaration procedure.</p>
<p>From the date of the reform, the enterprises shall no longer be required to provide the verification and writing-off bill when handing the export declaration.</p>
<p>Article 4 Simplify the export tax refund vouchers.</p>
<p>For the goods which are exported and declared to the Customs after August 1, 2012 (based on the date indicated by Customs on the Customs Declaration Form of Export Goods (exclusively for Export Tax Refund), hereafter the same), the export enterprises applying for export tax refund shall be no longer required to provide the verification and writing-off bills. The competent local taxation bureaus shall, according to the information provided by the competent foreign exchange bureaus on the foreign exchange proceeds from export of such enterprises and the categorization thereof, examine the export tax refund of such enterprises in accordance with relevant provisions.</p>
<p>For the goods which are exported and declared to the Customs before August 1, 2012, have not arrived at the verification and writing-off period for foreign exchange proceeds from export before July 31, 2012, and have not been verified and written-off, export tax refund shall be handled according to the provisions of Paragraph 1 of this Article. </p>
<p>For the goods which are exported and declared to the Customs before August 1, 2012, have not arrived at the verification and writing-off period for foreign exchange proceeds from export before July 31, 2012 but have been verified and written-off, or have arrived at the verification and writing-off period for foreign exchange proceeds from export, export refund shall be handled according to the provisions of export tax refund before the reform.</p>
<p>Article 5 Disposal of the foreign exchange proceeds from export which have not been verified and written-off after the expiration.</p>
<p>For the goods which are exported and declared to the Customs before August 1, 2012, and have arrived at the verification and writing-off period for foreign exchange proceeds from export before July 31, 2012, the enterprises shall handle the verification and writing-off procedure for foreign exchange proceeds from export before July 31, 2012. From August 1, 2012, the foreign exchange bureaus shall not handle the verification and writing-off procedure for foreign exchange proceeds from export and shall not issue the verification and writing-off bills. Where the enterprises really need relevant foreign exchange proceeds certificates as issued by the foreign exchange bureaus, the foreign exchange bureaus shall carry out disposal on a case-by-case basis by referring to the relevant provisions of original verification and writing-off supervision for foreign exchange proceeds from export.</p>
<p>Article 6 Strengthen the inter-departmental joint supervision.</p>
<p>Enterprises shall strictly comply with relevant provisions, increase their awareness of good faith, strengthen self-disciplinary management and comply with applicable laws and regulations in business operation. The State Administration of Foreign Exchange shall further strengthen the cooperation with General Administration of Customs and the State Administration of Taxation by realizing proper information sharing; improve the coordination mechanism by forming cooperative supervision force; severely crack down the flow of various illegal and transnational funds and illegal practice of smuggling and tax fraud. </p>
<p>Specific matters concerning foreign exchange administration, export declaration and export tax refund involved in this Announcement shall be separately provided by relevant departments. Where other rules are inconsistent with this Announcement, this Announcement shall prevail. From August 1, 2012, the regulations as listed in the Appendix of this Announcement shall be repealed.</p>
