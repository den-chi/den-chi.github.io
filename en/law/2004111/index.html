            <div id="page-content">
                <p>March 13, 2014</p>
<p>Article 1 In order to normalize the examination and approval of domestic market sales and the customs supervision of the leftover pieces, surplus pieces, defective products, by-products, damaged bonded goods produced from the bonded imported materials and parts of processing trade, Measures of the Customs of the People's Republic of China for the Administration of Leftover Pieces, Surplus Pieces, Defective Products, By-products and Disaster-damaged Bonded Goods in Processing Trade (Revised in 2014) (hereinafter referred to as the "Measures") are hereby formulated in accordance with the Customs Law of the People's Republic of China (hereinafter referred to as the "Customs Law") and other pertinent laws and administrative regulations.</p>

<p>Defective products refer to the products (including finished and semi-finished products) produced in the operation of processing for re-export by a trade processing enterprise, which have major defects in the production process or fail to meet the requirements of the export contract and cannot be re-exported.</p>
