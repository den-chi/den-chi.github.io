For the purpose of guaranteeing the implementation of the Opinions, the General Administration of Customs has formulated the Measures of the Customs of the People's Republic of China for the Punishment of the Illegal Domestic Sale or Transfer of Bonded Goods under Processing Trade (hereafter referred to as "the Measures"), which are hereby transmitted to you and shall be promulgated to the public as Order of the General Administration of Customs No. 76.

<p>Appendix: Measures of the Customs of the People's Republic of China for the Punishment of the Illegal Domestic Sale or Transfer of Bonded Goods under Processing Trade</p>
<p>Article 1 These Measures are formulated in accordance with the Customs Law of the People's Republic of China (hereafter referred to as "the Customs Law), the Implementing Rules of the Customs Law of the People's Republic of China on Administrative Penalties (hereafter referred to as "the Implementing Rules") and the Opinions on Further Improving the Deposit Account System for Processing Trade jointly formulated, upon approval of the State Council, by the State Economic and Trade Commission, the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, the General Administration of Customs, the Ministry of Finance, the State Administration of Taxation, the People's Bank of China, and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (hereafter referred to as "the Opinions").</p>
<p>Article 2 Bonded materials and parts imported for processing trade shall be used in processing export products, and processing trade products shall be re-exported within the specified time limit.</p>
<p>Article 3 As to unauthorized domestic sale of bonded materials, parts or finished products under processing trade, which constitutes the crime of smuggling, the case shall be transferred to the competent judicial authority for investigation over criminal liability. Where such unauthorized sale does not constitute the crime of smuggling, or the competent people's court decides not to investigate criminal liability, the customs shall impose a punishment in accordance with Item 4 of Article 3 or Article 5 of the Implementing Rules.</p>
<p>Article 4 Where an enterprise transfers, charges, or exchanges any of its bonded materials, parts or finished products under processing trade without permission of the customs, the customs shall order it to recover such materials, parts or finished products, and impose on the enterprise a fine of less than the equivalent value of, or less than twice the amount of taxes and duties payable on, the goods involved in accordance with Item 2 of Article 11 of the Implementing Rules; in the case of unauthorized transfer of bonded parts, materials or products under processing trade, in which the transferred materials, parts or finished products cannot be recovered, the customs shall recover the taxes and duties payable on such materials, parts or finished products and interest payable thereon, and impose on the enterprise a fine of between 50% and 100% of the equivalent value of the goods involved, or between one time and two times the amount of taxes and duties payable on the goods in accordance with the said provisions.</p>
<p>Article 5 In the case of shortage of bonded materials, parts or finished products , for which no proper reason is provided or relevant records are not truthful, the customs shall recover the taxes and duties payable on such materials, parts or finished products as well as interest payable thereon, and impose a fine of less than the equivalent value of, or less than twice the amount of taxes and duties payable on, the goods involved in accordance with Item 3 of Article 11 of the Implementing Rules.</p>
<p>Article 6 Where bonded materials, parts or finished products need to be transferred or used in the production of products sold on the domestic market due to special reasons, such transfer or use shall be reported to the competent provincial foreign trade and economic cooperation department for review and approval, and the customs shall handle the relevant procedures for domestic sale or transfer in accordance with the approval certificate of the competent foreign trade and economic cooperation department, and collect taxes and duties on the imported materials and parts as well as interest payable thereon in accordance with relevant provisions of the State. Where any of the imported materials or parts falls within the commodities under import licensing by the State, the operation entity concerned shall submit the import license to the customs within the statutory write-off period. Where the operation entity fails to provide the abovementioned import license within the statutory write-off period, the customs shall impose on the operation entity a fine of between 30% and 100% of the equivalent value of the imported materials and parts in accordance with Article 7 of the Opinions.</p>
<p>Article 7 Where bonded materials, parts or finished products concerned are transferred or used in the production of products sold on the domestic market with approval by the competent provincial foreign trade and economic cooperation, but without the approval by the customs, and the previously exempted taxes and duties on the bonded materials, parts or finished products are paid, the customs may, in addition to recovery of the taxes and duties payable as well as interest thereon, impose a fine of 50% of the equivalent value of the materials and parts sold on the domestic market in accordance with Item 2 of Article 11 of the Implementing Rules.</p>
<p>As to imported materials and parts that are transferred with approval by the competent provincial foreign trade and economic cooperation department but without prior permission of the customs, and on which the previously exempted taxes and duties are paid, such materials and parts shall be subject to the provisions under the preceding paragraph if such materials and parts fall within the commodities under import licensing by the State and the import license issued by the competent authorities within the statutory export write-off period can be provided at the time of subsequently reporting the transfer to the customs or discovering the transfer subsequently by the customs; in the event that the import license cannot be provided, or the import license provided is issued after the expiration of the said export write-off period, or the approval certificate of the competent provincial foreign trade and economic cooperation department cannot be provided, the customs shall handle such transfer in accordance with Article 4 of these Measures.</p>
<p>Article 8 As to bonded materials, parts or finished products that have exceeded the write-off period specified by the customs (including the approved extension thereof) and of which neither export nor application for domestic sale is made, the customs shall, in addition to imposing a punishment in accordance with Item 6 of Article 13 of the Implementing Rules, require the operation entity to obtain the approval certificate of the competent provincial foreign trade and economic cooperation department and the import license in accordance with Article 10 of the Implementing Rules. Where the said certificate and license are provided, the domestic sale shall be approved and the previously exempted taxes and duties on the materials, parts or finished products as well as interest payable thereon shall be paid; where the certificate and license fail to be provided, or the approval procedures for domestic sale fail to be completed with the competent provincial foreign trade and economic cooperation department, the customs shall sell off such materials, parts or finished products in accordance with Article 21 of the Customs Law, and the proceeds shall be kept for one year. Where an application is made for return of the proceeds and the domestic sale approval certificate and the import license are provided within such one-year period, the proceeds shall be returned after the deduction of the taxes and duties as well as interest thereon, fines, and the storage and sale cost; if the relevant certificate and license still fail to be provided, the proceeds shall be submitted to the state treasury after the deduction of all relevant costs and fees in accordance with Article 21 of the Customs Law.</p>
<p>Article 9 After the customs decides to punish an enterprise, it shall timely notify such decision to the competent foreign trade and economic cooperation department in accordance with relevant provisions.</p>
<p>Article 10 As to an enterprise which has either been punished by the customs for smuggling or has been punished by the customs for three times or more for violation of the provisions on customs supervision, the enterprise shall be subject to customs regulation as a Category D enterprise under the classification system by the customs; except that the existing processing trade contracts continue to be performed, the customs shall not accept the registration of its processing trade contracts and the import and export declarations until the enterprise's right to engage in processing trade or its import and export business is resumed by the competent foreign trade and economic cooperation department.</p>
<p>Article 11 Administrative punishments by the customs against illegal domestic sale or transfer of bonded goods under processing trade shall be subject to the procedures under the Implementing Rules; where no applicable procedure is available under the Implementing Rules, or such procedures are in conflict with the Law on Administrative Punishments, applicable procedures under the Law on Administrative Punishments shall apply.</p>
<p>Article 12 These Measures shall come into force as of October 1, 1999.</p>
