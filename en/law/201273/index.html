<p>Where an employee violates the stipulation on the term of service, it shall pay liquidated damages to the employer. The amount of such liquidated damages may not exceed the training fees provided by the employer. The liquidated damages that the employer requires the employee to pay may not exceed the training fees to be apportioned in the remaining part of the term of service.</p>
<p>Where an employer and an employee agree on the term of service, the increase in labor remuneration of the employee during the term of service according to the normal wage adjustment mechanism is not affected.</p>
<p>(Relevant articles: Practical materials 3 Precedents 1)</p>
<p>Article 23 An employer and an employee may specify, in the labor contact, the employer's trade secrets and confidential matters relevant to intellectual property rights.</p>
<p>With regard to an employee who has the obligation of maintaining confidentiality, the employer may agree on the competitive restriction clause in the labor contract or the confidentiality agreement with the employee, and agree on the economic compensation monthly paid to the employee within the competitive restriction period after the rescission or termination of the labor contract. Where an employee violates the competitive restriction clause, the employee shall pay liquidated damages as agreed to the employer.</p>

<p>the employer exempts itself from the statutory responsibility or excludes the rights of employees; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the mandatory provisions of laws or administrative regulations are violated.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Where there is a dispute over the invalidity or partial invalidity of a labor contract, it shall be confirmed by the labor dispute arbitration authority or the people's court.</p>
<p>Article 27 Where a labor contract is partially invalid, without affecting the validity of other parts, other parts remain valid.</p>
<p>Article 28 Where a labor contract is confirmed to be invalid, and the employee has already worked for the employer, the employer shall pay labor remuneration to the employee. The amount of labor remuneration is determined by referring to the labor remuneration of an employee of the same or similar position of the employer.</p>
