As provided in Article 111 of the Implementation Regulations for the Income Tax Law, transfer pricing methods include the comparable uncontrolled price method, the resale price method, the cost plus method, the transactional net margin method, the profit split method, and other approaches that are in compliance with the arm's length principle.</p>
<p>Article 22 A comparable analysis shall be conducted in selecting and employing a reasonable transfer pricing method. A comparable analysis shall mainly include the following five aspects:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The characteristics of assets or labor services involved in a transaction, mainly including the physical characteristics, quality, quantity, and other aspects of tangible assets, the nature and scope of labor services, the types of intangible assets, its modes of trade, term and scope, expected earnings and other aspects; </p>

<p>The capabilities and risks of all parties to the transaction; the capabilities mainly include research and development, design, purchase, processing, assembling, manufacturing, stock management, distribution, after sales service, advertising, transportation, warehousing, financing, financial, accounting, legal and human resources management abilities; in comparing capabilities, attention shall be paid to the extent of similarity between assets employed by the enterprises concerned in playing their respective roles; the risks mainly include research and development risk, purchase risk, production risk, distribution risk, marketing promotion risk, management risk and financial risk and other risks;</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>The economic environment, mainly including an overview of the sector involved, geographic location, market size, market hierarchy, market share, the extent of market competition, consumer purchasing power, the alternativity of the goods or labor services involved, prices for elements involved in the production, the cost of transportation, government regulations, and others; and </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Business strategies, mainly including innovation and development strategies, multiple-sector business strategies, risk avoidance strategies and market share strategies and other strategies.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Article 23 Under the comparable uncontrolled price method, a price charged between non-associated parties for business activities equal or similar to related-party transactions is regarded as the arm's length price. </p>
<p>A comparable analysis shall pay special attention to differences between related-party transactions and non-related-party transactions in terms of the characteristics of the assets or labor services involved in the transactions, the terms and conditions of the contracts involved and the economic environment and contain specifically the following matters depending on different types of transactions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Purchase and sale or transfer of tangible assets </li>
</ol>
<p>(1) Processes for such purchase and sale or transfer, including the time and place of the transaction involved, the conditions of delivery, delivery procedures, the conditions of payment, the quantity of the goods involved in the transaction, the time and place of after sales services, and other matters; </p>
<p>(2) Stages involved in such purchase and sale or transfer, including the ex-factory stage, the wholesaling stage, the retailing stage, the export stage, and other stages; </p>
<p>(3) Goods involved in such purchase and sale or transfer, including the name, brand, specifications, size, function, structure, shape, package and other aspects of the goods; and</p>

<ol>
<li>Employment of tangible assets </li>
</ol>
<p>(1) The function, specifications, size, structure and type of such assets and a depreciation method for such assets;</p>
<p>(2) The time of, term for and place of access to such assets; </p>
<p>(3) Investment expenditure, maintenance cost and other expenses on such assets paid by the owner of such assets.</p>
<ol>
<li>Transfer and employment of intangible assets </li>
</ol>
<p>(1) The type and purpose of such intangible assets, any industry to which such intangible assets is fit, and its expected earnings; and </p>
<p>(2) Conditions for the development of such intangible assets, any investment in it and its transfer, the exclusivity of such intangible assets, the extent to which and term for which it is protected under relevant laws, its transfer cost and expenses, particulars on its functions and risks, its alternativity, and other matters. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Financing: the amount of financing, the type of currency involved, the term of such financing, any guarantee for such financing, the creditworthiness of the financier concerned, the manners of repayment, and interest calculation methods, and other matters. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provision of labor services: the nature of such services, technical requirements for such services, the professional level of such services, the assumption of responsibilities, the conditions and manners of payment, the direct and indirect cost of such services, and other matters. Where an related-party transaction differs substantially from a comparable non-related-party transaction in the aforesaid aspects, reasonable adjustments shall be made to the effect of such difference on the price involved. Where it is impossible to make reasonable adjustments thereto, another reasonable transfer pricing method shall be selected in accordance with provisions of this Chapter.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The comparable uncontrolled price method may apply to all types of related-party transactions.</p>
<p>Article 24 Under the resale price method, a price at which an associated party resells to any non-associated party goods purchased by the associated party and from which the gross profits of an comparable non-related-party transaction is subtracted shall be regarded as the arm's length price for purchasing the goods. The formula for such arm's length price is set out as follows:</p>
<p>Arm's length price=price at which a resale is made to a non-associated party x (1-the gross profit margin of a comparable non-related-party transaction)</p>
<p>The gross profit margin of a comparable non-related-party transaction=the gross profits of the comparable non-related-party transaction/the net earnings of the comparable non-related-party transaction x 100%</p>
<p>A comparable analysis shall pay special attention to any difference between an related-party transaction and a non-related-party transaction in terms of functions, risks, and the terms and conditions of the contracts involved and to other factors which have impact on the gross profit margin involved, specifically including the functions of sales, advertising and services, inventory risks, the value and useful life of the machinery and equipment involved, the employment and value of the intangible assets involved, the wholesaling or retailing stage, business experience, the efficiency of accounting and management, and other factors.</p>
<p>Where an related-party transaction differs substantially from a comparable non-related-party transaction in the aforesaid aspects, reasonable adjustments shall be made to the effect of such difference on the gross profit margin involved. Where it is impossible to make reasonable adjustments thereto, another reasonable transfer pricing method shall be selected in accordance with provisions of this Chapter.</p>
<p>The resale price method generally applies to simple processing business in which a reseller does not carry out any substantial value-added processing activities such as modifying the shape, function, structure of the goods involved or changing the trademark of the goods or to pure purchase and sale business.</p>
<p>Article 25 Under the cost plus method, the arm's length price shall be reasonable cost incurred for an related-party transaction plus the gross profit of a comparable non-related-party transaction. The formula for such arm's length price is set out as follows:</p>
<p>Arm's length price= reasonable cost for an related-party transaction x (1+ the cost plus rate of a comparable non-related-party transaction)</p>
<p>The cost plus rate of a comparable non-related-party transaction= the gross profits of the comparable non-related-party transaction/the cost of the comparable non-related-party transaction x 100% </p>
<p>A comparable analysis shall pay special attention to any difference between an related-party transaction and a non-related-party transaction in terms of functions, risks, and the terms and conditions of the contracts involved and to other factors which have impact on the cost plus rate involved, specifically including the functions of manufacture, processing, installation, and testing, market and exchange rate risks, the value and useful life of the machinery and equipment involved, the employment and value of the intangible assets involved, the wholesaling or retailing stage, business experience, the efficiency of accounting and management, and other factors.</p>
<p>Where an related-party transaction differs substantially from a comparable independent transaction in the aforesaid aspects, reasonable adjustments shall be made to the effect of such difference on the cost plus rate involved. Where it is impossible to make reasonable adjustments thereto, another reasonable transfer pricing method shall be selected in accordance with provisions of this Chapter.</p>
<p>The cost plus method generally applies to related-party transactions involving the purchase and sale, transfer and employment of tangible assets, the provision of labor services, or financing.</p>
<p>Article 26 Under the transactional net margin method, the net profits of an related-party transaction shall be determined on the basis of the profit margin indicators of a comparable non-related-party transaction. The profit margin indicators of a comparable non-related-party transaction include return on assets, sales margin, total cost plus rate, Berry ratio and other margin indicators.</p>
<p>A comparable analysis shall pay special attention to any difference between an related-party transaction and a non-related-party transaction in terms of functions, risks, and the terms and conditions of the contracts involved and to other factors which have impact on the business profits involved, specifically including executive functions, the assumption of risks, the employment of assets, the conditions of the sector and market involved, the size of business, economic cycle, product life cycle, the apportion of cost, expenses, income and asset among all parties to the transactions, the efficiency of accounting and management, and other factors.</p>
<p>Where an related-party transaction differs substantially from a comparable independent transaction in the aforesaid aspects, reasonable adjustments shall be made to the effect of such difference on the business profits involved. Where it is impossible to make reasonable adjustments thereto, another reasonable transfer pricing method shall be selected in accordance with provisions of this Chapter.</p>
<p>The cost plus method generally applies to related-party transactions involving the purchase and sale, transfer and employment of tangible assets, the transfer and employment of intangible assets and the provision of labor services.</p>
<p>Article 27 Under the profit split method, the amount of profits that shall be distributed respectively to an enterprise and its associated party shall be calculated on the basis of contribution to the consolidated profits of the associate transaction involved made respectively by them. The profit split method consists of the general profit split method and the surplus profit split method.</p>
<p>Under the general profit split method, profits that shall be distributed to all parties to an related-party transaction shall be determined on the basis of roles played, risks assumed and assets employed by all parties.</p>
<p>Under the surplus profit split method, the surplus profits shall be the sum remained after normal profits distributed to all parties to an related-party transaction are subtracted from the consolidated profits and all parties shall distribute the surplus profits on the basis of their respective contribution.</p>
<p>A comparable analysis shall pay special attention to roles played, risks assumed and assets employed by all parties to the transaction in question, the apportion of cost, expenses, income and asset among all parties, accounting, and the reliability of information and assumptions employed to ascertain contribution made by all parties to the surplus profits.</p>
<p>The surplus profit split method generally applies to situations in which related-party transactions are so closely integrated that it is difficult to make separate evaluations on the results of transactions for all parties thereto.</p>
<p>Chapter V Transfer Pricing Investigations and Adjustments</p>
<p>Article 28 Taxation authorities shall have the power to identify, in accordance with provisions of the Tax Administration Law and its Detailed Implementation Rules for tax inspections, enterprises to be investigated in order to make transfer pricing investigations and adjustments.

<ol>
<li>
<p>The enterprise shall provide the relevant information within the period specified in the Notice of Taxation Matters and, in the case of a failure to do so due to any special reason, shall submit to the taxation authority a written request of extension and may, after the approval of the taxation authority, delay in providing such information for a maximum period of up to thirty days.

<p>Chapter IX Administration of Thin Capitalization</p>
<p>Article 85 Interest expenses not allowed to be deducted in calculating taxable income as described in Article 46 of the Income Tax Law, shall be calculated according to the following formula: </p>
<p>Interest expenses not allowed to be deducted=annual interest actually paid to all associated parties x (1-the standard ratio/associated liability-asset ratio )</p>
<p>In the formula, the standard ratio is the ratio specified in the Circular of Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation Concerning Issues of Relevant Tax Policies on Criteria for the Pre-tax Deduction of Interest Expenses Paid by Enterprises to Associated Parties (Cai Shui [2008] No. 121).</p>
<p>The associated liability-asset ratio is the percentage by which debt investments accepted by an enterprise from all of its associated parties (hereinafter refereed to as associated debt investments) in accordance with the provisions of Article 46 of the Income Tax Law and Article 119 of the Implementation Regulations for the Income Tax Law account for equity investments accepted by the enterprise (hereinafter referred to as equity investments). Associated debt investments include debt investments for which associated parties provide security by way of various manners.</p>
<p>Article 86 The specific calculation method for the associated liability-asset ratio is as follows:</p>
<p>The associated liability-asset ratio =the sum of average associated debt investments for each month within a year/ the sum of average equity investments for each month within the same year</p>
<p>In the foregoing formula:</p>
<p>Average associated debt investments for each month= (book balance for such associated debt investments at the beginning of each month+ book balance for such associated debt investments at the end of each month)/2</p>
<p>Average equity investments for each month= (book balance for such equity investments at the beginning of each month + book balance for such equity investments at the end of each month)/2</p>
<p>Equity investment is the amount of owner's equity set out on the balance sheet of an enterprise; where the owner's equity is less than the sum of paid-in capital(capital stock) and capital surplus, the equity investment is the sum of paid-in capital (capital stock) and capital surplus; where the sum of paid-in capital (capital stock) and capital surplus is less than the paid-in capital(capital stock) , the equity investment is the amount of the paid-in capital(capital stock).</p>
<p>Article 87 The term "interest expenses" as used in Article 46 of the Income Tax Law includes any interest, guarantee fee, mortgage fee, and other expenses with the nature of interest actually paid by an enterprise for direct or indirect associated debt investments.</p>
<p>Article 88 Interest expenses not allowed to be deducted in calculating taxable income, as described in Article 46 of the Income Tax Law, shall not be carried over to subsequent taxable years and shall be distributed among all associated parties according to percentages by which interest actually paid to each associated parties accounts for the total amount of interest paid to all associated parties; interest distributed to any domestic associated party whose tax burden is heavier than the enterprise concerned is allowed to be deducted. Interest paid directly or indirectly to overseas associated parties shall be deemed as distributed dividends and enterprise income tax shall then be levied on such interest by the difference between income tax rates applicable respectively to such dividends and interest. Where the amount of income tax withheld exceeds that of income tax levied on such dividends, such excess shall not be refunded.</p>
<p>Article 89 Where an enterprise, in calculating taxable income, seeks to deduct interest expenses by which the associated liability-asset ratio exceeds the standard ratio, the enterprise shall, in addition to complying with the provisions of Chapter III hereof, prepare, preserve and, as required by a taxation authority, provide the following same-period documents to prove that the amount, interest rate, term, and financing conditions of its associated debt investments as well as its liability-assets ratio, among others, comply with the arm's length principle:</p>
