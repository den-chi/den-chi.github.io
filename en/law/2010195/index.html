<p>Article 24 An operating enterprise may undertake outward processing business and shall follow the provisions regarding the outward processing to handle filing formalities with Customs within three working days after being contracted out.</p>
<p>When processing trade is contracted out, the operating enterprise may not sell the processing trade goods to the undertaking enterprise. The undertaker may not subsequently contract the processing trade goods.</p>
<p>If the operating enterprise contracts out all processes, it shall provide guarantee of the same value as that of the payable taxes of outward processing goods or a letter of guarantee from a bank or a non-banking financial institution while handling filing formalities.</p>
<p>Article 25 Upon the approval of the competent Customs at the place where the enterprise is located, an operating enterprise does not necessarily transport processing trade goods such as the finished products, leftover materials, residual materials, inferior products and byproducts generated during the outward processing back to itself.</p>
<p>Article 26 If Customs implements supervision over processing trade goods, the operating enterprise and undertaker shall cooperate with the Customs.</p>

<p>Article 28 If an operating enterprise must use non-bonded materials due to the needs of processing techniques, it shall submit a faithfully declaration of the proportion, category, specification, type, and quantity of the non-bonded materials to be used to Customs in advance.</p>
<p>If the operating enterprise submits a declaration to Customs in accordance with Paragraph 1 of Article 28, Customs shall write off those non-bonded materials from the total materials consumed for the finished export products.</p>
<p>Article 29 In the event that an operating enterprise needs to return to or change the imported materials with the original supplier as a result of quality problem or non-conformity of the imported materials with the specification or type as stipulated in the contract and non-processing bonded materials are exported due to needs of after-sale services of processing trade goods exported, it may handle the customs declaration formalities directly with the port Customs.</p>
<p>Bonded imported materials that have already been processed may not be returned or changed.</p>
<p>Chapter IV Verification and Writing-off of Processing Trade Goods</p>
<p>Article 30 The operating enterprise shall process and re-export the imported materials within the prescribed time limit and shall report to Customs for verification and writing-off within 30 days from the day of export of the last batch of finished products under the manual of processing trade or the day of expiration of the manual of processing trade.</p>
<p>In the event that a contract concluded by an operating enterprise with a foreign party is terminated before expiration, the enterprise shall report to Customs for verification and writing-off within 30 days from the day of termination of the contract.</p>
<p>Article 31 An operating enterprise shall, when reporting for verification and writing-off, faithfully declare the information about the imported materials, the finished export products, leftover materials, residual materials, inferior products, byproducts and unit consumption and shall submit the relevant documents in accordance with the provisions.</p>
<p>If the operating enterprise reports to Customs for verification and writing-off in accordance with Paragraph 1 of this article and submits complete and valid documents, Customs shall accept the report for verification and writing-off.</p>
<p>Article 32 Customs may undertake the verification and writing-off via paper documents or electronic data and may go to the factories to conduct inspections if necessary and the enterprise shall render cooperation.</p>
<p>Customs shall complete the verification and writing-off within 30 days from the day of the acceptance of the report. In the event that it is necessary to extend the period due to special circumstances, it may be extended for 30 days upon approval of the director of Customs directly under the GACC or the director of the subordinate Customs authorized thereby.</p>
<p>Article 33 In the event that the imported materials or finished products under processing trade are instead sold on the domestic market due to certain reasons, Customs may, on the strength of the valid document of approval for domestic sale issued by the competent authority, collect taxes on the bonded imported materials in accordance with the law and collect additional interest for late tax collection, unless otherwise stated.</p>
<p>In the event that the imported materials fall within the import restrictions imposed by the State, the operating enterprise shall also submit the import license to the Customs.</p>
<p>Article 34 In the event that an operating enterprise returns the imported materials under processing trade out of China, Customs shall complete the verification and writing-off on the strength of the relevant certificate of returning.</p>
<p>Article 35 The leftover materials, residual materials, inferior products, and byproducts generated by the operating enterprise during the production process as well as bonded goods suffering losses from disasters shall be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of Customs regarding the administration of such materials and goods. Customs shall complete the verification and writing-off on the strength of the relevant documents.</p>
