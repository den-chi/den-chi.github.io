<ol>
<li>Where by reason of the provisions of paragraph 1, a person other than an individual is a resident in both Contracting States, and then it shall be deemed to be a resident only in the State in which its place of effective management is situated.</li>
</ol>
<p>Article 5 Permanent Establishment</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>For the purposes of this Agreement, the term "permanent establishment" means a fixed place of business through which the business of an enterprise is wholly or partly carried on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The term "permanent establishment" includes especially:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>(1) A place of management;</p>
<p>(2) A branch;</p>
<p>(3) An office;</p>
<p>(4) A factory;</p>
<p>(5) A workshop; and</p>
<p>(6) A mine, an oil or gas well, a quarry or any other place of extraction of natural resources.</p>
<ol>

</ol>
<p>(1) A building site, a construction, assembly or installation project or supervisory activities in connection therewith, but only where such site, project or activities continue for a period of more than six months;</p>
<p>(2) The furnishing of services, including consultancy services, by an enterprise of a Contracting State through employees or other personnel in the other Contracting State, provided that such activities continue for the same project or a connected project for a period or periods aggregating more than six months within any twelve- month period.</p>
<ol>
<li>Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 to 3, the term "permanent establishment" shall be deemed not to include:</li>
</ol>
<p>(1) The use of facilities solely for the purpose of storage, display or delivery of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise;</p>
<p>(2) The maintenance of a stock of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise solely for the purpose of storage, display or delivery;</p>

<p>(5) The maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for the purpose of carrying on, for the enterprise, any other activity of a preparatory or auxiliary character;</p>
<p>(6) The maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for any combination of the activities mentioned in sub-paragraphs (a) to (e), provided that the overall activity of the fixed place of business resulting from this combination is of a preparatory or auxiliary character.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article, where a person, other than an agent of an independent status to whom the provisions of paragraph 6 apply, is acting in a Contracting State on behalf of an enterprise of the other Contracting State, has and habitually exercises an authority to conclude contracts in the name of the enterprise, that enterprise shall be deemed to have a permanent establishment in the first-mentioned Contracting State in respect of any activities which that person undertakes for the enterprise, unless his activities are limited to those mentioned in paragraph 4 which, if exercised through a fixed place of business, would not make this fixed place of business a permanent establishment under the provisions of that paragraph.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An enterprise of a Contracting State shall not be deemed to have a permanent establishment in the other Contracting State merely because it carries on business in that other Contracting State through a broker, general commission agent or any other agent of an independent status, provided that such persons are acting in the ordinary course of their business. However, when the activities of such an agent are devoted wholly or almost wholly on behalf of that enterprise, he will not be considered an agent of an independent status within the meaning of this paragraph.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fact that a company which is a resident of a Contracting State controls or is controlled by a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State, or which carries on business in that other State (whether through a permanent establishment or otherwise), shall not of itself constitute either company a permanent establishment of the other.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Article 6 Income From Immovable Property</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Income derived by a resident of a Contracting State from immovable property situated in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other Contracting State.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The term "immovable property" shall have the meaning which it has under the laws of the Contracting State in which the property in question is situated. The term shall in any case include property accessory to immovable property, livestock and equipment used in agriculture and forestry, rights to which the provisions of general law respecting landed property apply, usufruct of immovable property and rights to variable or fixed payments as consideration for the working of, or the right to work, mineral deposits, sources and other natural resources; ships and aircraft shall not be regarded as immovable property.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The provisions of paragraph 1 shall apply to income derived from the direct use, letting, or use in any other form of immovable property.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 3 shall also apply to income from immovable property of an enterprise.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Article 7 Business Profits</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State shall be taxable only in that Contracting State unless the enterprise carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein. If the enterprise carries on business as aforesaid, the profits of the enterprise may be taxed in the other Contracting State but only so much of them as are attributable to that permanent establishment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subject to the provisions of paragraph 3, where an enterprise of a Contracting State carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein, there shall in each Contracting State be attributed to that permanent establishment the profits which it might be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealing wholly independently with the enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In determining the profits of a permanent establishment, there shall be allowed as deductions expenses which are incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment, including executive and general administrative expenses so incurred, whether in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated or elsewhere. However, no such deduction shall be allowed in respect of amounts, if any, paid (otherwise than towards reimbursement of actual expenses including royalties, fees, interest or other similar payments) by the permanent establishment to the head office of the enterprise or any of its other offices, by way of royalties, fees or other similar payments in return for the use of patents or other rights, or by way of commission, for specific services performed or for management, or, except in the case of a banking enterprise, by way of interest on moneys lent to the permanent establishment. Likewise, no account shall be taken, in the determination of the profits of a permanent establishment, for amounts charged (otherwise than towards reimbursement of actual expenses including royalties, fees, interest or other similar payments) by the permanent establishment to the head office of the enterprise or any of its other offices, by way of royalties, fees or other similar payments in return for the use of patents or other rights, or by way of commission for specific services performed or for management, or, except in the case of a banking enterprise by way of interest on moneys lent to the head office of the enterprise or any of its other offices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Insofar as it has been customary in one Side to determine the profits to be attributed to a permanent establishment on the basis of an apportionment of the total profits of the enterprise to its various parts, nothing in paragraph 2 shall preclude that Side from determining the profits to be taxed by such an apportionment as may be customary. The method of apportionment adopted shall, however, be such that the result shall be in accordance with the principles contained in this Article.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No profits shall be attributed to a permanent establishment by reason of the mere purchase by that permanent establishment of goods or merchandise for the enterprise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where profits include items of income which are dealt with separately in other Articles of this Agreement, then the provisions of those Articles shall not be affected by the provisions of this Article.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where profits include other income items in other paragraphs, then the provisions of this Article shall not affect those other paragraphs in other Articles.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Article 8 Shipping, Air and Land Transport</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Income from the operation of ship or aircraft or land vehicle in international traffic carried on by an enterprise which is a resident of a Contracting State shall be exempt from tax (Business Tax of mainland China included) in the other Contracting State, unless the ship or aircraft is operated solely between places within the other Side.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The provisions of paragraph 1 shall also apply to income and profits derived from the participation in a pool, a joint business or an international operating agency.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Article 9 Associated Enterprises</p>
<ol>
<li>Where</li>
</ol>
<p>(1) An enterprise of a Contracting State participates directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of the other Contracting State, or</p>
<p>(2) The same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of a Contracting State and an enterprise of the other Contracting State, and in either case conditions are made or imposed between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which would be made between independent enterprises, then any profits which would, but for those conditions, have accrued to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly.</p>
<ol>
<li>Where a Contracting State includes in the profits of an enterprise of that State - and taxes accordingly - profits on which an enterprise of the other Contracting State has been charged to tax in that other State and the profits so included are profits which would have accrued to the enterprise of the first-mentioned State if the conditions made between the two enterprises had been those which would have been made between independent enterprises, then that other State shall make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of the tax charged therein on those profits. In determining such adjustment, due regard shall be had to the other provisions of this Agreement and the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall, if necessary, consult each other.</li>
</ol>
<p>Article 10 Dividends</p>
