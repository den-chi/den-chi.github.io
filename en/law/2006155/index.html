                <p>Measures of the Customs of the People's Republic of China for the Administration of Unit Consumption in Processing Trade (Revised in 2014)</p>
<p>Order of the General Administration of Customs No.218</p>
<p>March 13, 2014</p>
<p>Chapter I General Provisions</p>
<p>Article 1 In accordance with the provisions of the Customs Law of the People's Republic of China and other relevant laws and administrative regulations, the Measures of the Customs of the People's Republic of China for the Administration of Unit Consumption in Processing Trade (Revised in 2014) (hereinafter referred to as the "Measures") are formulated for the purpose of regulating the administration of unit consumption in processing trade (hereinafter referred to as the "unit consumption") and promoting the sound development of processing trade.</p>
<p>Article 2 The Measures shall apply to the administration of unit consumption by customs.</p>
<p>Article 3 The term "unit consumption" refers to the quantity of materials consumed for the processing of one unit of finished product by a processing trade enterprise under the normal processing conditions. Unit consumption can be divided into net consumption and technique consumption.</p>
<p>Article 4 A processing trade enterprise shall, in the link of the establishment of the manual of processing trade, report the unit consumption to the customs for the record.</p>
<p>Article 5 The administration of unit consumption shall comply with the principles of making declarations as well as verifications and write-offs in light of the facts.</p>
<p>Article 6 In the event that a processing trade enterprise provides materials involving business secrets for customs, requires customs to keep them confidential and submits a written application to the customs, customs must keep the information confidential in accordance with the law. No processing trade enterprise may, under the pretext of keeping secrets, refuse to provide the related materials to customs.</p>
<p>Chapter II Standards for Unit Consumption</p>
<p>Article 7 The term "standards for unit consumption" refers to the norms of the quantity of materials consumed for a finished product unit in the processing trade, which are for general use or may be used repeatedly. A maximum upper value shall be set for the standards for unit consumption and a minimum lower value shall be set in addition for the standards for unit consumption of the export taxable finished products.</p>
<p>Article 8 The standards for unit consumption shall be formulated by customs in concert with the concerned departments according to the related provisions.</p>
<p>Article 9 The form of public announcement of customs shall be adopted to promulgate the standards for unit consumption.</p>
<p>Article 10 The standards for unit consumption shall apply to the processing trade enterprises beyond the areas under special customs supervision or bonded supervision while the standards may not apply to the processing trade enterprises within such areas.</p>
<p>Article 11 A processing trade enterprise beyond the areas under special customs supervision or bonded supervision shall, within the standards for unit consumption, make an archival filing of or declare the unit consumption to customs.</p>
<p>In the event that the unit consumption declared by a processing trade enterprise beyond the areas under special customs supervision or bonded supervision falls within the standards for unit consumption, customs shall, on the basis of the declared unit consumption, verify and write-off the bonded materials. If the declared unit consumption is beyond the standards, the customs shall, on the basis of the maximum upper value or minimum lower value of the standards for unit consumption, verify and write-off the bonded materials.</p>
<p>Article 12 In the event that the standards for unit consumption are not yet published, a processing trade enterprise shall faithfully declare the unit consumption to customs, and customs shall verify and write-off the bonded materials according to the actual unit consumption of the processing trade enterprise.</p>
<p>Chapter III Declaration of Unit Consumption</p>
<p>Article 13 The term "declaration of unit consumption" refers to the act in which processing trade enterprises report unit consumption to the customs.</p>
<p>Article 14 Before a finished product is exported, moves into deep processing or is sold in the domestic market, a processing trade enterprise shall faithfully declare its unit consumption to customs.</p>
<p>In the event that a processing trade enterprise fails to declare its consumption on schedule by virtue of justified reasons, it shall retain a sample of the finished product and the related documents and file an application in written form before the export, deep processing or domestic sale of the finished product. The processing trade enterprise may, upon the approval of the competent customs, declare its unit consumption before reporting the same for verification.</p>
<p>Article 15 A processing trade enterprise shall declare the following contents for its unit consumption:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>name, serial number, unit, specification, mode and quality of the materials and finished products under the processing trade;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>unit consumption for the finished products under the processing trade; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in the event that the same kind of materials for processing trade is composed of both bonded and non-bonded items, the proportion, name, unit, specification, mode and quality of the non-bonded materials shall be declared.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Article 16 Technique consumption does not apply under the following circumstances:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>any consumption of bonded materials, semi-finished or finished products owing to the sudden failure of power, water or gas or any other artificial reason;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>any consumption of bonded materials, semi-finished or finished products owing to loss, damage or for any other reason;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>any consumption such as the loss, damage or lack of bonded materials, semi-finished or finished products due to force majeure;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>any consumption incurred from the increase of materials because the quality or specification of any import bonded material or exported finished product fails to comply with the requirements of the contract;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>any consumption of non-bonded materials used as technique ingredients; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>any consumption of consumptive materials in the processing process.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Article 17 A processing trade enterprise shall adopt the form of paper or electronic data to declare its unit consumption.</p>
<p>Article 18 A processing trade enterprise may not apply to customs for the conduction of the formalities for changing or revoking unit consumption, under any of the following conditions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>export declaration for the bonded finished product has already been completed;</p>
</li>

<p>Chapter IV Verification of Unit Consumption</p>
<p>Article 19 "Verification of unit consumption' refers to the act in which customs verifies whether or not the unit consumption declared by a processing trade enterprise complies with the related provisions and whether it accords with the actual situation in the processing process.</p>
<p>Article 20 In order to verify the authenticity and accuracy of unit consumption, customs may exercise the following powers:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>to consult and copy samples, images, pictures, patterns, qualities, compositions, specifications, modes of materials and finished products, processing contracts, order forms, processing plans, processing statements, cost accountings and other accounting books and materials;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to consult and copy technique flow charts, discharge diagrams, bills of quantity, burdens, standards for quality inspection and any other material which can reflect the technical requirements, processing technique processes and corresponding consumption of materials of the finished products;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to require a processing trade enterprise to provide the method and formula for calculation for verification of unit consumption;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to examine any bonded material or finished product or select samples for inspection or testing;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to inquire of the legal representative, chief person in charge and the related personnel of a processing trade enterprise about the situation and problems relevant to unit consumption;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to enter the storage or processing place of a processing trade enterprise to examine the goods relevant to the unit consumption and their processing condition; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to carry out on-spot measurements on unit consumption of processed products and retain samples if necessary.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Article 21 Customs shall verify the unit consumption declared by a processing trade enterprise and accept the declaration in case of its compliance with the related provisions.</p>
<p>Article 22 In the event that customs is in doubt of the authenticity or accuracy of the unit consumption as declared by a processing trade enterprise, it shall formulate and issue the Notice of the Customs of the People's Republic of China Concerning the Challenge of Unit Consumption in Processing Trade (hereinafter referred to as the "Notice Concerning the Challenge of Unit Consumption", see Appendix for its format) to expound the reasons for the challenge to the legal representative or agent of the processing trade enterprise in writing.</p>
<p>Article 23 The legal representative or agent of a processing trade enterprise shall provide the related written materials to customs within ten working days upon receipt of the Notice Concerning the Challenge of Unit Consumption.</p>
<p>Article 24 In the event that a processing trade enterprise fails to provide the related materials within the time limit specified by the customs, or the provided materials are insufficient or it is impossible to determine the unit consumption by means of the materials provided, customs shall check and determine the unit consumption.</p>
<p>Article 25 Methods such as technical analysis, actual measurement and cost accounting may be adopted either solely or comprehensively by customs to check and determine the unit consumption declared by a processing trade enterprise.</p>
<p>Article 26 By paying guaranty money or providing a bank guarantee, a processing trade enterprise may, upon the approval of customs, go through the formalities of customs beforehand for the import and export, moving forward to deep processing or domestic sales of the materials and finished products of processing trade before the unit consumption is verified. If the processing trade enterprise carries out the actual operation of bank guarantee money and the amount in the actual operation is not less than the taxable amount, provision of guarantee may be exempted.</p>
<p>Article 27 In the event that any processing trade enterprise has any objection to the verification results of its unit consumption, it may file an application in written form for reverification to the higher level of customs, which shall make a reverification decision within 45 days upon receipt of the application for reverification.</p>
<p>Chapter V Supplementary Provisions</p>
<p>Article 28 The terms used in the Measures are defined as follows:</p>
<p>"net consumption" refers to the quantity of materials that exist in or are converted into finished unit product through physical change or chemical reaction via processing.</p>
<p>"technique consumption" refers to the quantity of the materials other than net consumption that must be consumed in the normal processing course but may not exist in or be converted into the finished product because of the processing technique, including both tangible and intangible consumption.</p>
<p>"technique consumption rate" refers to the proportion of technique consumption to the consumed materials, namely unit consumption = net consumption / (1 – technique consumption rate).</p>
<p>"method of technical analysis" refers to the method that customs uses to verify the unit consumption of finished product by analyzing and calculating elements affecting the unit consumption such as structure, ingredients, composition and techniques of finished product.</p>
<p>"method of actual measurement" refers to the method that customs uses to measure the unit consumption in the processing course by weighing and calculating and then verifying the unit consumption of finished product through comprehensive analysis.</p>
<p>"method of cost accounting" refers to the method that customs uses to calculate and verify the unit consumption of finished product by contrasting and analyzing such statistical data on the consumption of raw materials as accounting books, processing records and warehouse accounting books.</p>
<p>Article 29 In the event that any act of smuggling is committed or any supervisory provision of customs is violated by violating the Measures, the violator shall be punished by customs under the related provisions of the Customs Law of the People's Republic of China and the Implementing Regulations of the Customs of the People's Republic of China on Administrative Penalties. In the event that a crime is committed, the violator shall be subject to criminal liabilities in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>Article 30 The General Administration of Customs shall be responsible for the interpretation of the Measures.</p>
<p>Article 31 The Measures shall come into force as of March 1, 2007.
