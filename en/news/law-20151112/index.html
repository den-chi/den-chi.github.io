            <hr /><p>2015-11-12</p>
            <div id="page-content">
                <p>SAT Announcement [2015] No. 76</p>
<p>November 12, 2015</p>
<p>The Measures for Handling Corporate Income Tax Preferences, which are formulated by the State Administration of Taxation with a view to transforming government functions, optimizing tax payment services, raising the management level, and effectively implementing the various preferential corporate income tax policies, are hereby promulgated as follows:</p>
<p>It is hereby announced.</p>
<p>Measures for Handling Corporate Income Tax Preferences</p>
<p>Article 1 In order to meet the requirements of the State Council on reducing the administrative approval procedures, decentralizing powers and further improving administrative services, and standardize the procedures for handling corporate income tax preferences ("CIT Preference"), these Measures are formulated pursuant to the Corporate Income Tax Law of the People's Republic of China (the "Corporate Income Tax Law") and the Regulations on the Implementation thereof, the Tax Administration Law of the People's Republic of China (the "Tax Administration Law") and the Rules on the Implementation thereof, and the Announcement of the State Administration of Taxation on Promulgating the Administrative Measures for Tax Reduction and Exemption (Announcement of the State Administration of Taxation [2015] No. 43).</p>
<p>Article 2 CIT Preference mentioned herein refers to preferences specified in the Corporate Income Tax Law, and preferences stipulated by the State Council and governments of ethnic autonomous regions pursuant to the Tax Law, including tax-free incomes, deductible taxable incomes, weighted deductions, accelerated depreciations, income tax credits, taxable income deductions, tax rate cuts, tax credits, and tax credits for ethnic autonomous regions.</p>
<p>Businesses mentioned herein refer to resident businesses specified in the Corporate Income Tax Law.</p>
<p>Article 3 Businesses shall judge for themselves whether they meet the requirements of related preferential tax policies. Businesses entitled to CIT Preference shall file with the tax authority and properly keep related documents pursuant to provisions hereof. For documents to be submitted, see the Catalog of Corporate Income Tax Preferences Subject to Filing Administration ("Catalog", see Appendix 1).</p>
<p>The Catalog is formulated and will be updated from time to time by the State Administration of Taxation.</p>
<p>Article 4 Filing mentioned herein refers to the submission of the Filing Form for Corporate Income Tax Preferences ("Filing Form", see Appendix 2) and related supporting documents by businesses to the tax authority pursuant to the provisions hereof.</p>
<p>Article 5 Supporting documents mentioned herein refer to contracts (agreements), certificates, documents, account books and other data related to CIT Preference enjoyed by businesses. The specific supporting documents shall be in accordance with the Catalog.</p>
<p>The state and local tax bureaus of all provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the Central Government, and cities specifically designated in the state plan ("Provincial Tax Authority") may jointly specify supplementary supporting documents pursuant to the actual conditions on the basis of the Catalog.</p>
<p>Article 6 Businesses shall assume legal responsibilities for the authenticity and legality of the filing documents and supporting documents they submit.</p>
<p>Article 7 Businesses shall perform the filing procedure at or before the date of submission of the annual tax returns.</p>
<p>Article 8 Businesses enjoying CIT Preference for a fixed period of time shall perform the filing procedure in the first year when the preference is granted. Thereafter, they are not required to perform the filing procedure again until the conditions for such preference are changed. Businesses enjoying other CIT Preference shall go through the filing procedures annually.</p>
<p>In case businesses enjoy a number of preferences in the meantime, or certain preference must be accounted for under different items, filing shall be performed respectively, including weighted deductions and income tax credits for R&amp;D expenditures, and tax credits on buying special equipment for environmental protection, energy and water conservation and safe production, and other preferences.</p>
<p>Fixed-period CIT Preference shall be in accordance with those specified in the "Overview of Preferential Policies" section of the Catalog.</p>
<p>Article 9 Where the conditions for CIT Preference are changed in the validity period after the filing for fixed-period CIT Preference, the following shall be observed:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Businesses that still meet the requirements of relevant preferential policies shall perform the filing change procedure with the tax authority within 15 days from the date of change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Businesses that no longer meet the relevant provisions of the Tax Law shall stop to enjoy CIT Preference.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Article 10 Businesses shall fill in the Filing Form truthfully and completely, and shall submit necessary paper-based documents. The tax authority shall keep the photocopies of paper-based documents and return the originals to businesses after the formal review.</p>
<p>Businesses enjoying CIT Preference for small and meager-profit businesses or accelerated depreciation (one-time deduction inclusive) policies for fixed assets shall fill in corresponding sections of the tax return.</p>
<p>Article 11 Businesses may perform the filing procedure at the office of the tax authority, or via the Internet. Businesses that need to submit paper-based documents pursuant to the requirements hereof shall perform the filing procedure at the office of the tax authority.</p>
<p>The specific filing methods shall be determined by the Provincial Tax Authority.</p>
<p>Article 12 The related tax authority shall examine the Filing Form and related information for completeness pursuant to the following requirements:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Where the Filing Form and information meet the relevant requirements, the tax authority shall accept the filing and give comments, the date of acceptance, and attach the official seal of the tax authority to the Filing Form.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where the Filing Form or information does not meet the relevant requirements, the tax authority shall notify related businesses to make corrections within a specified period of time. If the Filing Form and information meet the requirements after the corrections, the tax authority shall accept the filing in a timely manner.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For businesses filing at the office of the tax authority, acceptance comments shall be given on the spot. For businesses filing via the Internet, the tax authority shall give acceptance comments within two working days after receiving the electronic filing information.</p>
<p>Article 13 For CIT Preference that has been granted to businesses, if the relevant requirements cannot be satisfied, adjustments shall be made.</p>
<p>Article 14 CIT Preferences concerning consolidated corporate taxpayers with branches located in a number of regions (provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the Central Government and cities specifically designated in the state plan) shall be handled as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Income tax credits, weighted deductions for R&amp;D expenditures, and tax credits for promoting employment and employment of the handicapped, for regional development of the western region, special economic zones, the Pudong New District of Shanghai, the Qianhai region of Shenzhen, the Hengqin region of Guangdong, and the Pingtan region of Fujian, and for buying special-purpose equipment for environmental protection, energy and water conservation and safe production to be enjoyed by branches shall be filed by the secondary branches with the tax authority. Other CIT Preferences shall be filed by head offices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The head offices of consolidated corporate taxpayers shall put together a list of CIT Preferences filed by their secondary branches (see Appendix 3) and submit it to the competent tax authority, together with the annual corporate income tax returns.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>CIT Preferences concerning consolidated corporate taxpayers with branches located in the same regions (provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the Central Government and cities specifically designated in the state plan) shall be filed with the Provincial Tax Authority.</p>
<p>Article 15 Businesses shall provide related supporting documents within the time limits specified by the tax authority to prove that they meet the requirements for CIT Preference.</p>
<p>In case a business cannot provide related supporting documents, or the documents are not compliant with the actual production and operation conditions, financial accounts, or related technical or industrial documents, catalogs or qualification certificates, and fails to prove that it meets the requirements for CIT Preference, the tax authority shall demand payment of the amount of tax reduced or exempted, and take measures pursuant to the provisions of the Tax Administration Law.</p>
<p>Businesses shall keep the supporting documents for ten years after CIT Preference is granted. In case of any discrepancy between the provisions of the Tax Law and the accounting practice, the supporting documents shall be kept for ten years after the validity of CIT Preference expires.</p>
<p>Article 16 Businesses that have been enjoying CIT Preference but have not performed the required filing procedure shall perform the filing procedure and submit documents pursuant to the Catalog in a timely manner, and the tax authority shall urge such businesses to perform the required filing procedure and submit documents pursuant to the Catalog within a certain period of time.</p>
<p>Article 17 The tax authority shall tighten the administration of CIT Preference pursuant to the provisions hereof, and shall not arbitrarily change the administrative measures on CIT Preference without authorization nor conduct administrative examination and approval in a disguised manner for any reason. The tax authority shall provide all-around excellent filing services for businesses.</p>
<p>Article 18 The tax authority shall give warnings against risks if they have any doubt about the CIT Preference application documents submitted by a business. If necessary, they may urge the business concerned to perform the filing procedure in advance or review their documents.</p>
<p>Article 19 The tax authority shall adopt tax risk management, inspection, tax payment appraisal and other follow-up management measures for businesses enjoying CIT Preference.</p>
<p>Article 20 Where a tax authority finds that a business is not entitled to CIT Preference pursuant to the Tax Law in follow-up inspections, the tax authority shall revoke the entitlement to CIT Preference, and demand payment of taxes payable and overdue fines. Any fraudulent act shall be addressed pursuant to the relevant provisions of the Tax Administration Law.</p>
<p>Article 21 For fixed-period CIT Preference for which the examination, approval, verification or filing formalities have been completed before the implementation of these Measures, no further filing is required.</p>
<p>Article 22 These Measures shall apply to the filing for CIT Preference in and after 2015.</p>
