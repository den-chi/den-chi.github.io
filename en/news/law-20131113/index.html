                <p>Announcement of the State Administration of Taxation on Issues Concerning Value-added Tax and Consumption Tax on Export Goods and Labor Services</p>
<p>Announcement of the State Administration of Taxation No. 65 [2013]</p>
<p>November 13, 2013</p>
<p>In order to further regulating management and accurately implementing the taxation policy of export goods and labor services, the issues concerning value-added tax and consumption tax on export goods and labor services are hereby announced as follows:</p>
<p>Article 1 Where export enterprises or other entities that apply for cancellation of recognition of tax rebate (exemption) qualification have declared to the competent taxation authority for forgoing undeclared export tax rebate (exemption) or declared export tax rebate (exemption) not yet handled and apply for tax exemption according to provisions, they shall be deemed having settled export tax rebate payment. </p>
<p>Where export enterprises or other entities apply for cancellation of recognition of tax rebate (exemption) qualification due to merger, division, restructuring and reorganization or other reasons (hereinafter referred to as "cancellation enterprises"), they may declare and submit to the competent taxation authority the Confirmation of Non-settlement of Tax Rebate (Exemption) by Enterprises Applying for Cancellation of Recognition of Tax Rebate (Exemption) Qualification (Appendix I). Enterprises that provide resolution on merger, division or restructuring and reorganization of enterprises, articles of association, the approval document of the relevant departments and succeed to the rights and obligations of the cancellation enterprises (hereinafter referred to as "succeeding enterprises") may, with the confirmation of the competent taxation authority, go through the formalities for cancellation of recognition of tax rebate (exemption) qualification before settlement of export tax rebate (exemption) payment by the cancellation enterprises at the place of the account opening bank and account number of the cancellation enterprises. After cancellation, the rebatable tax payment of the cancellation enterprises shall be returned to the account of the succeeding enterprises by the competent taxation authority. </p>
<p>Article 2 Export enterprises or other entities may forgo tax rebate (exemption) of all export goods and labor services to which tax rebate (exemption) policy is applicable, and opt for applicable value-added tax exemption policy or tax levy policy. Export enterprises or other entities that forgo the applicable tax rebate (exemption) policy shall submit the Declaration of Forgoing Tax Rebae (Exemption) of Export Goods and Labor Services to the competent taxation authority (Appendix II) to go through the filing formalities. Within 36 months from the second day of filing, export goods and labor services to which tax rebate (exemption) policy is applicable shall be subject to value-added tax exemption policy or tax levy policy.</p>
<p>Article 3 Where production enterprises that engage in imported material processing business fail to determine the planned rate of allocation of imported material processing business for the year without the verified manuals (ledgers) of the customs of the previous year, they shall use the consolidated actual rate of allocation for verified manuals (ledgers) of the previous year determined in the most recent time as the planned rate of allocation for the year.</p>
<p>After handling annual verification of imported material processing business, where production enterprises consider that the consolidated actual rate of allocation for verified manuals (ledgers) for the previous year in the Verification Form for Tax Exemption, Offsetting and Rebate for Imported Material Processing Business of Production Enterprises is relatively different from the actual situation of the enterprise of the year, they may, after providing the planned allocation rate of imported material processing for the year and written justifiable reasons, use the planned allocation rate of imported material processing as the planned allocation rate for the year.</p>
<p>Article 4 Where export enterprises that commission the processing and recovery for export of processing trade imported materials provide invoices for processing fees that are not issued by the processing entities indicated on the processing trade manuals (ledgers) at the time of declaration of tax rebate (exemption) or application for issuing the Certification of Tax Exemption of Imported Material Processing, export enterprises must explain the reasons in writing to the competent taxation authority and provide the written certification issued by the competent customs. Otherwise, where it falls under commissioned processing business of imported material processing, the corresponding processing fees shall not be offset or declared for tax rebate (exemption). Where it falls under commissioned processing business of imported material processing, no application for issuing the Certification of Tax Exemption of Imported Material Processing shall be made, the corresponding processing fees shall not be declared for tax exemption.</p>
<p>Article 5 Where export enterprises make customs declaration for entry into state approved export processing zones, bonded logistics parks, bonded harbor zone, integrated bonded zones, Zhuhai-Macau Cross-border Industrial Zone (Zhuhai Park), Sino-Kazakhstan Horgos International Border Cooperation Center (Chinese ancillary region), bonded logistics centers (type B) (hereinafter collectively referred to as "special zones") and sell goods to the entities within the special zones or foreign entities or individuals and settle in Renminbi, they may declare export tax rebate (exemption). Where they provide information on receipt of foreign exchange according to provisions, they may provide the proof of receipt of Renminbi.</p>
<p>Article 6 Export enterprises or other entities that declare tax rebate (exemption) of export goods for external assistance do not need to provide the duplicate of the approval document for the use of external assistance preferential loan approved by the Ministry of Commerce ("letter of duty for external assistance") and the duplicate of the approval document for the use of joint venture cooperation project funds approved by the Ministry of Commerce ("letter of duty for external assistance").</p>
<p>Article 7 Production enterprises that purchase goods from outside without processing or assembling by the enterprises and assembling as a whole set of products with self-produced goods of the enterprises directly after export, where such goods are exported on an ancillary basis to foreign entities or individuals importing self-produced goods of the enterprises, they may declare tax rebate (exemption) as deemed self-produced goods. Where production enterprises declare tax rebate (exemption) of deemed self-produced goods for export, they shall, according to the Reference Table of Business Types of Deemed Self-produced Goods for Export by Production Enterprises (Appendix III), fill in the corresponding mark in the column "business type" in the Particulars of Declaration of Tax Exemption, Offsetting and Rebate for Export Goods of Production Enterprises. Where the competent taxation authority finds that enterprises have filled in wrong information, it shall timely request rectification by enterprises.</p>

Where declaration of tax exemption is not made in the following month, value-added tax levy policy shall apply.</p>
<p>Article 11 Where goods are commissioned for export, the consignor shall submit the Certification of Goods for Export on Consignment (Appendix IV) and the electronic data thereof to the competent taxation authority on the strength of the (duplicate) of the export agreement for agency consignment from the date of customs declaration of goods to March 15 the next year.

<p>Article 12 Where foreign trade enterprises export goods deemed domestic sales for tax levy and apply for issuing the Certification of Export Goods for Domestic Sales, they shall provide the prescribed supporting information and the duplicate of accounting documents of calculation and provision of sales tax. </p>
<p>Where the competent taxation authority verifies the Application Form for Certification of Export Goods for Domestic Sales and the information for cross audit of value-added tax special invoices does not match, and finds that the value-added tax special invoice or other value-added tax deduction document provided falls under any of the following circumstances, no Certification of Export Goods for Domestic Sales shall be issued:</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The value-added tax special invoice provided is cancelled at the time of tax registration by supplying enterprises or is issued after recognition as unusual account;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The goods indicated on the proof of imported goods in the Declaration Form of Certification of Export Goods for Domestic Sales declared at the time foreign trade enterprises conduct domestic sales of export goods do not match with the names of export goods indicated on the export goods manifests for declaration of tax exemption or rebate, except for consolidated customs declaration of various spare parts of the same goods under the same commodity name;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The self-produced goods sold by supplying enterprises where the production facilities and tools thereof cannot produce such goods;</p>
</li>
