                <p>date: 2013/11/18</p>

<p>Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Several Major Issues Concerning Comprehensively Deepening Reforms</p>
<p>November 12, 2013</p>
<p>With a view to implementing the strategic deployment about comprehensively deepening reforms that is proposed at the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (hereinafter referred to as the "CPC" or the "Party"), the Third Plenary Session of the 18th CPC Central Committee has studied several major issues concerning comprehensively deepening reforms and made the following decisions.</p>
<p>Article 1 Significance and Guiding Ideology of Comprehensively Deepening Reforms</p>
<ol>
<li>Reform and opening-up, as a new great revolution made by Chinese people of all ethnic groups and led by the Party under the heading of "new era", are of the most distinctive features of contemporary China. Over the 35 years since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, our Party, with great political courage and determination, has been promoting the reforms of systems on economy, politics, culture, society, ecological civilization and the Party's construction and continuously expanding the scope of opening up. Its great determination, deep reforms and wide influence are unprecedented, and the achievements have attracted worldwide attention.</li>
</ol>
<p>The main achievement of the reform and opening up is the creation and development of socialism with Chinese characteristics, which provides strong incentive and powerful guarantee for the socialist modernization construction. It is proven that the reform and opening up is the crucial choice that shapes up the destiny of contemporary China and is the important magic weapon for the Party and the people to keep up with the times.</p>
<p>There is no end to the practice of development, to the emancipation of minds and to the reform and opening up. Facing the new situation and new task, in order to build a well-off society in an all-round way so as to form a prosperous, democratic, civilized and harmonious modern socialist country and realize the Chinese dream about the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, we must comprehensively deepen reforms from this new historical starting point, keep strengthening self-confidence in the road, the theory and the system of socialism with Chinese characteristics.</p>
<ol>
<li>For the purpose of comprehensively deepening reforms, we must hold high the great banner of socialism with Chinese characteristics and follow the guidance of Marxism and Leninism, Maoism, Deng Xiaoping Theory, the important thought of "Three Represents" and the Scientific Outlook on Development; firm the confidence, build consensus, plan as a whole, push forward cooperatively and adhere to the direction of socialist market economy reform; take the promotion of social fairness and justice and the improvement of the people's well-being as both our starting point and ultimate goal to further emancipate the mind, emancipate and develop the social productivity, and emancipate and enhance the social vitality; resolutely remove disadvantages in all aspects of systems and mechanisms, and strive to develop a broader prospect for the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics.</li>
</ol>
<p>The overall goal of comprehensively deepening reforms is to improve and develop the socialist system with Chinese characteristics and promote the modernization of national governance system and governance ability. We must focus more on whether the reforms are systematic, holistic and collaborative, speed up the development of the socialist market economy, democratic politics, advanced culture, harmonious society and ecological civilization, release all the gushing vitality of the labor, knowledge, technology, management and capital, give full play to all sources of social wealth, and make more development benefit shared by all the people in a fairer way.</p>
<p>We shall deepen the reform of economic system by closely sticking to the decisive role of the market in resource allocation, to uphold and improve the fundamental economic system, accelerate to improve the modern market system, the macroeconomic regulation and control system and the open economy system, accelerate the transformation of the pattern of economic development, and speed up the construction of an innovation-oriented country, so as to promote the economy to develop in a more efficient, fairer and more sustainable way.</p>
<p>We shall deepen the reform of political system by closely sticking to the organic unity of ensuring the leadership of the Party, the people as the masters of the country and ruling by law, to accelerate socialist democracy's institutionalization, standardization and sequencing and build a socialist country under the rule of law, so as to develop a more extensive, more comprehensive and healthier people's democracy.</p>
<p>We shall deepen the reform of cultural system by closely sticking to the establishment of the socialist core value system and socialist country with great culture, to speed up to perfect the culture management system and the cultural production and management mechanism, and establish and perfect the modern system of public cultural service and the modern cultural market system, so as to promote the vigorous development and prosperity of the socialist culture.</p>
<p>We shall deepen the reform of social system by closely sticking to the better safeguard and improvement of people's livelihood and promotion of social fairness and justice, to reform the income distribution system, promote the common prosperity, advance system innovation in the social domain, drive the equalization of basic public services, and speed up the formation of scientific and effective social governance system, so that the society is full of vitality and develops in a harmonious and orderly way.</p>
<p>We shall deepen the reform of ecological civilization system by closely sticking to the construction of beautiful China, to accelerate the establishment of ecological civilization system, and improve the institutions and mechanisms of national spatial development, economical utilization of resources and ecological environment protection, so as to promote the formation of a new pattern of modernization construction characterized by the harmonious development of man and nature.</p>
<p>We shall deepen the reform of the Party's construction system by closely sticking to the improvement of the level of scientific, democratic and law-based governance, to strengthen the construction of democratic centralism, improve the Party's leadership system and governing style and maintain the Party's advanced nature and purity, so as to provide strong political guarantee for the reform and opening up and the socialist modernization construction.</p>
<ol>
<li>Comprehensively deepening reforms must be carried out, based on the biggest reality that our country will remain in the primary stage of socialism for a long time, by insisting on the major strategic judgment that development is still the key to solve all problems of our country and taking economic construction as the center, in order to give play to the tractive role of the economic system reform, promote the correlation between production relations and productive forces and between superstructure and economic base, and promote the sustainable and healthy development of the economy and the society.</li>
</ol>
<p>The reform of the economic system is the focus of comprehensively deepening reforms. The core is to correctly handle the relationship between government and market so as to help the market play a decisive role in the allocation of resources and help the government better play its role. The market determining the allocation of resources is the general law of market economy. Therefore, to perfect the system of socialist market economy, we must follow this law and put forth efforts to solve the imperfection of the market system and the excessive intervention and the lack of regulation by the government.</p>
<p>We must actively and prudently advance market-oriented reform in breadth and depth, greatly reduce the government's direct allocation of resources, and promote the allocation of resources on the basis of market rules, market prices, market competition to achieve maximum benefit and efficiency optimization. The government's role and responsibilities mainly include maintaining the stability of macro-economy, strengthening and optimizing the public services, safeguarding fair competition, reinforcing market regulation, maintaining the market order, promoting sustainable development, advancing the common prosperity and making up for market failure.</p>
<ol>
<li>The success practice of the reforms and opening up provides important experience for the comprehensively deepening reform and must be insisted upon in the long run. Most importantly, we shall adhere to the leadership of the Party, carry out the Party's basic line, reject both the old and rigid closed-door policy and any attempt to abandon socialism and take an erroneous path, unswervingly follow the road of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and always ensure the correct direction of reforms. We shall insist on emancipating the mind, seeking truth from facts, keeping pace with the times, being practical and advancing everything from its current status, summarize the successful practices in China, draw lessons from foreign experience, and be brave to promote the innovation in theory and practice. We shall adhere to the concept of putting people first, respect the principal position of the people, develop the public's pioneering spirit, rely firmly on the people to advance reforms and promote the all-round development of people. We shall insist on the good handling of the relationship among reform, development and stability, be brave and take steady steps, strengthen the combination of top-down planning and wading across the river by feeling the stones, advance the reform comprehensively with breakthroughs made in key areas, make the reform decisions more scientific and broadly build consensus, to form combined force of reform.</li>
</ol>
<p>At present, as our country enters a new stage of development, the reform has reached the crucial stage and waded into the deep water zone. We must start with a strong historical sense of mission, centralize the wisdom of the Party and the whole society to the greatest extent, try the best to mobilize all positive factors, dare to "take a bigger bite" and wade through a dangerous shoal, break through the bondage of ideas and the barriers of interest solidification with the greater determination, and promote self-improvement and development of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics.</p>
<p>Till 2020, decisive results will be achieved through reforms in important fields and crucial links, the reform tasks put forward herein will be accomplished, and a systematic, complete, scientific and standardized system in effective operation will be established, which all make every aspect of the system become more mature and more stable.</p>
